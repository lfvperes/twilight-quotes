6
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,113
Who's there?

7
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,950
Who's there?



9
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:20,735
Help!



11
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,396
What do you want?





14
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,376
BELLA: "Some say the
world will end in fire"

15
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,516
"Some say in ice"

16
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:42,254
"From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire"

17
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:46,953
"But if I had to perish twice"

18
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,527
"I think I know enough of hate"

19
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:54,628
"To say that for destruction ice"

20
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,239
"Is also great"

21
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,875
"And would suffice"

22
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,509
You know, I've got an English final.

23
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,809
I gotta focus.

24
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,133
Marry me.

25
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,496
No.

26
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,712
Marry me.

27
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,819
Change me.

28
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,495
Okay, I will if you marry me.

29
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,724
It's called a compromise.

30
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,269
Let's just call it coercion.

31
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,898
It's not fair.

32
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,570
Marriage is just...

33
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,636
It's a piece of paper.

34
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,015
Where I'm from,
it's the way one says, "I love you."

35
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,884
Well, where I come from, at my age,

36
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,918
it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up."

37
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,896
So, you're worried
about what people will think?

38
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,005
You know,
two out of three marriages end in divorce.

39
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:41,547
Well, I think you'll find
the vampirel human divorce rate

40
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,412
is a little lower.

41
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,856
So marry me.

42
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,727
I can't.

43
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,925
I have to be back at 4:00.



45
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,350
4:00 on the dot.

46
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:28,854
That kid trying to brown-nose me now
or something?

47
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:33,056
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?

48
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,637
Okay.

49
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,745
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

50
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,747
I know, I put you through hell.

51
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:51,410
Yes, you did.

52
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:56,147
But I have other reasons for grounding you.

53
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:57,521
Like...

54
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,665
I just want you to get some separation
from him.

55
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,094
Dad, there's nothing you can say.

56
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,203
Edward is in my life.

57
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,771
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

58
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:23,443
So, all right, how about this?

59
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,053
I'll make you a deal.

60
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,649
You're not grounded anymore

61
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:36,896
if you use your new-found freedom to see
some of your other friends, too, like...

62
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:38,757
Like Jacob.

63
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,263
He's going through
a really tough time right now.

64
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,532
His dad's really worried about him.

65
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,337
I remember when that was you.

66
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,409
You needed a friend.

67
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,371
Jake was there.


Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.



70
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:03,255
BELLA: Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.

71
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:07,930
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.



















81
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,245
You scared me.

82
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:06,903
You're going down to the reservation.

83
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,483
How did you...

84
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,189
Alice.

85
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,189
Hey, did you do this to my truck?

86
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,493
Bella, you have to understand.

87
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,333
Your safety is everything to me.

88
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:22,838
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.

89
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,637
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control.

90
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,734
Edward.

91
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:31,109
I have until graduation to see him.

92
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,410
And then I'll be one of you,

93
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,221
and he'll hate me forever.

94
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,319
Well, I'm sorry.



96
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:54,534
JESSICA: No way. Stop.
MIKE: Throw it away.

97
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:55,937
Good.
Hey.

98
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,568
Just in time. All right, check it out.
All right. Let's see, we got.

99
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:01,169
"My fellow students." Right?
Good.

100
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,544
Cute.
Right? "We are the future."

101
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,913
"Anything is possible,
if you just believe."

102
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,144
Nice.

103
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,053
ERIC: Perfect.

104
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,349
And you got yourself a speech.

105
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:13,687
No, this'll be my speech when I want
everyone to throw diplomas at my head.

106
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,351
So, thank you.

107
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,460
You gotta embrace the cliches, Jess.

108
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,896
They are the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

109
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,527
And that is why you are not valedictorian.

110
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,729
Jess doesn't need cliches.

111
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:26,924
The speech is gonna be epic.

112
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,572
Epic? It'll change lives.

113
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:31,977
I've decided to throw a party.

114
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,245
After all, how many times
are we gonna graduate high school?

115
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,472
A party? At your place?

116
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:40,711
I've never seen your house.

117
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,311
No one's ever seen their house.

118
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,079
Another party, Alice?

119
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,516
It'll be fun.

120
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,287
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

121
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,823
Hey, Angela.
Yeah?

122
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,220
Do you need some help with those?

123
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,966
JESSICA: be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do,

124
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,100
and then you'll be raking it in.

125
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,202
MIKE: Wait a minute. People give you money?



127
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,358
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.

128
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:29,262
It was nothing.

129
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,033
You looked worried.

130
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,407
Just that everyone noticed
how strange Alice is.

131
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,846
I think that ship sailed long ago.

132
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,048
I wonder what's wrong.

133
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,883
EDWARD: Their son went missing in Seattle
over a year ago.

134
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,616
Charlie's doing what he can, but...

135
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,391
You know something about this?

136
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:01,332
We've been tracking the situation
in Seattle for a while.

137
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,736
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.

138
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,840
If the situation gets any more conspicuous,
the Volturi will step in.

139
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,907
If they go to Seattle,
they could come here.

140
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:15,449
They could see I'm still human.

141
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,109
It won't get that far.

142
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:20,048
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.

143
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,784
CHARLIE: I'll fax these down, first thing.
MR. BIERS: Thank you.

144
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,485
Hey.
Hey.

145
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,425
You ready for dinner?
Yeah.

146
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:34,564
It is still just you and I, right?

147
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,968
No, I'm just dropping her off.

148
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,831
See you later.

149
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,101
Bye.

150
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:47,236
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you
about the airline ticket

151
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,284
you got for your birthday.
What airline ticket?

152
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,582
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.

153
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:56,889
That was generous.

154
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,393
It expires soon,
so you might want to use it this weekend.

155
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:02,454
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.

156
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:05,793
It might be your last chance to see her
before you graduate.

157
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,003
CHARLIE: Might not be a bad idea.

158
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:12,438
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.

159
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:15,063
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.

160
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:19,007
As long as you use the companion ticket.

161
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,208
Wait. There's two tickets?

162
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,050
Super.

163
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:27,582
That makes me really happy.

164
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,457
BELLA: I did want to see my mom.

165
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:36,089
I wanted to know
that her life was full and satisfying.

166
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,495
RENEE: Aren't you gonna miss this?

167
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,372
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

168
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,272
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

169
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,115
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

170
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:02,283
I'm just saying,
if you go to the University of Alaska,

171
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,384
I'm never gonna see you.

172
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,932
They have a really great science program.

173
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,660
You mean, Edward program?

174
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,798
The way he watches you,

175
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,838
it's like he's willing to leap in front
of you and take a bullet or something.

176
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,277
Is that a bad thing?

177
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,347
It's an intense thing.

178
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,577
You're different with him.

179
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,148
He moves, you move.

180
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,316
Like magnets.

181
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:38,525
I don't know, we're just...

182
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:41,462
RENEE: In love. I get it.

183
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,759
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

184
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:49,751
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

185
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:56,173
All right, enough with the heavy.

186
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,346
Mom.

187
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:06,253
Congraduation.

188
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,087
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

189
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,922
I didn't, come on.



191
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,603
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:28,077
BELLA: Get out!
I saved them all.

193
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:31,172
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

194
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,218
Remember this one? Ensenada.

195
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,856
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

196
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,286
But this one is my favorite, here.

197
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,419
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

198
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:46,492
This is amazing.
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

199
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,055
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

200
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,430
have kids, we can add to it.

201
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:52,368
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

202
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:53,734
Thanks.

203
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,140
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:02,113
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

205
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,514
Mom...
Yeah?

206
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,757
I miss you.

207
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,726
Honey, I miss you, too.

208
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,846
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

209
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,778
She's almost here.

210
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:51,797
On your left!



212
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:28,993
Wait!

213
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,566
She's in their territory.

214
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,701
She'll get away!

215
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,967
No, she won't!

216
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,638
ESME: Emmett, no!





219
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,442
Do you regret going?

220
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,711
No.

221
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,653
It was really great seeing my mom.

222
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,492
Just really hard saying goodbye.

223
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,955
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

224
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,157
Is that why you asked me to go?

225
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,132
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

226
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,031
I'm always hoping for that.

227
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:11,833
What?

228
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,175
If I asked you to stay
in the car, would you?

229
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:23,850
Of course not.

230
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,560
Hey.

231
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,167
Charlie said you left town.

232
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,633
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

233
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,337
He's checking to see if you're still human.

234
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:48,539
Look, I'm here to warn you.

235
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,407
If your kind come on our land again...

236
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,206
Wait, what?

237
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,076
You didn't tell her?

238
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:58,681
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

239
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,790
Tell me what?

240
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,862
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

241
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,892
It's nothing to worry about.

242
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,295
JACOB: Listen to you.

243
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,494
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

244
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,297
You should just leave.

245
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,895
Now.

246
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,799
She has a right to know.

247
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:20,034
She is the one the redhead wants.

248
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,238
Victoria?

249
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,676
Alice's vision.

250
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:29,743
I was trying to protect you.

251
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,748
By lying to me.

252
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,521
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

253
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:38,721
You.

254
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:41,763
Why haven't you called me back?

255
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:46,269
I had nothing to say.

256
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,030
Well, I have tons. Hold on.
Hey.

257
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,341
Bella.

258
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,339
Edward, you have to trust me.

259
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:58,006
I do trust you.

260
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:00,048
It's him I don't trust.

261
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,663
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

262
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:15,757
Hold on tight.









267
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,410
Are you sure this is a good idea?

268
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,454
I am the vampire girl, remember?

269
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,022
Hey, look who's back!

270
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,258
What up, Bella?

271
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,986
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

272
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,487
Finally made the pack.

273
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,086
EMBRY: I'm glad you're here, Bella.

274
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,825
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

275
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:48,991
"I wish Bella would call."

276
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:50,799
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

277
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:53,668
"Maybe I should call Bella."
"Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."



279
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,135
All right, you can shut up now.

280
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:03,540
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

281
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:07,143
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

282
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:10,027
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

283
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:14,852
Fun, isn't she?

284
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:18,689
Bella, hi!
Hey.

285
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,865
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

286
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,299
BELLA: Yeah. Same here.

287
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:24,469
Sam, we good?

288
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:28,198
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

289
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,265
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

290
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,885
So when did Leah join the pack?

291
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:46,019
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

292
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,125
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

293
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:54,331
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

294
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,932
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

295
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:00,333
Come on, don't be such a guy.

296
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:02,875
No, it's not a chick thing.

297
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:06,041
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

298
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,275
We all have to live
the Leah Sam Emily pain-fest.

299
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,050
Wolf telepathy, remember?

300
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:15,881
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

301
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:20,425
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

302
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:23,754
But Emily was the one.

303
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,863
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

304
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:31,838
It's more than some crush, Bella.

305
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:34,067
Sam imprinted on Emily.

306
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:38,172
Do I even want to know what that is?

307
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:50,017
Imprinting on someone is like...

308
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,453
Like when you see her,

309
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,527
everything changes.

310
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,833
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

311
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:05,235
It's her.

312
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:08,006
Nothing else matters.

313
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:11,269
You would do anything,

314
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,610
be anything for her.

315
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,884
Sounds like you know the feeling.

316
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:25,057
Have you

317
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,131
imprinted on someone?

318
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,726
You'd know if I had.

319
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,935
I just have a direct
line to Sam's thoughts.

320
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,476
So for now you're

321
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,278
still you.

322
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,945
And you're still you.

323
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,283
Yeah.

324
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,127
Until graduation.

325
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,264
Graduation?

326
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,632
You knew this was gonna happen.

327
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,797
Not in a month!

328
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,245
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

329
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,306
Or before I could...



331
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,951
For a second, just a second, I thought...

332
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,189
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

333
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:34,660
I decided this, not him.

334
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:37,097
Bella, they're not even alive.

335
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,659
It makes me sick.

336
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,137
Better you really be dead than one of them.

337
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,889
I can't believe you said that.

338
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:06,792
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

339
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:09,765
Bella, come on. Please.

340
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:14,098
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:28,142
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

342
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:30,209
I was just with Jake.

343
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,083
Oh.

344
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,650
Good.



346
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:42,591
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

347
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,899
Hey.
Do you understand how worried I've been?

348
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,733
I was perfectly safe.

349
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,962
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

350
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,132
I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
No, something's wrong.

351
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:03,976
Edward, what's wrong?

352
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,041
Someone's been in here.

353
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:13,715
DR. CULLEN: Who was it?
Someone we know?

354
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,755
This stranger, I didn't
recognize his scent.

355
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,491
A nomad passing through?

356
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,565
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

357
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:25,938
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

358
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,707
Someone's orchestrating this.

359
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:30,141
Victoria?

360
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,369
I would have seen her decide.

361
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:33,705
Has to be the Volturi.

362
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:37,043
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

363
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:38,880
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

364
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:40,283
EMMETT: So we keep looking.

365
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,788
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

366
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,689
Another protection detail?

367
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:46,489
DR. CULLEN: Rosalie.

368
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:48,561
No, she's right.

369
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:53,466
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

370
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:55,297
And for Victoria.

371
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,030
And keep yourselves fed.

372
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:58,901
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

373
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:01,532
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

374
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,000
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

375
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,241
EDWARD: What?

376
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:17,353
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

377
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,790
It'll be hard to miss when we cross
it again. We'll handle it from here.

378
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:24,658
We don't need you to handle anything.

379
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:25,825
Or anyone.

380
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,561
I could care less what you need.

381
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,569
All right, we're done here.

382
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:31,605
No, you're done here.
BELLA: Stop!

383
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,932
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

384
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:39,212
BELLA: Edward hated the idea,

385
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,976
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

386
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:45,414
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

387
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:50,925
In the days that followed, I got them
to at least try to work together.

388
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,027
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

389
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:04,098
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.



391
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:21,718
Doesn't he own a shirt?

392
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,259
I'm good here. You should go.

393
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:31,158
I'm not gonna be gone long.

394
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,793
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

395
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,454
Maybe rush a little bit.

396
00:29:58,094 --> 00:29:59,891
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.



398
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,570
So, what do you wanna do today?

399
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:15,634
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

400
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:18,046
But we're going to a party tonight.

401
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,782
Are you sure this is okay?

402
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,684
I really hate being a party crasher.

403
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,785
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

404
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:34,190
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

405
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,156
She took over for Harry when he died.

406
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:39,032
Okay, I should not be here.

407
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,229
You're okay. I thought...

408
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,038
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

409
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,669
The histories?

410
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,148
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

411
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,613
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

412
00:30:57,421 --> 00:31:00,447
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

413
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:03,687
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

414
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,998
If I had known that, I would have, like...

415
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,301
I don't know, dressed better.
SETH: Jake!

416
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,563
Hey.
It's about time you got here.

417
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,667
Paul's been hoovering the grub,
but I saved you some burgers.

418
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,575
Good looking out, bro.

419
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,781
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

420
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,180
Hi.
Newest member of the pack.

421
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,012
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

422
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,577
And slowest.

423
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,193
Come on, your dad's about to start.
Okay.

424
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,259
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

425
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,926
but we have always had magic in our blood.

426
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,367
We were great spirit warriors,

427
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,535
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

428
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,972
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

429
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,310
and protect our tribe.

430
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:07,917
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

431
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,453
It looked like a man,

432
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,725
but it was hard like stone

433
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,365
and cold as ice.





436
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:40,617
Our warriors' sharp teeth
finally tore it apart,

437
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,890
but only fire would completely destroy it.

438
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,631
They lived in fear
that the cold man was not alone.

439
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,701
And they were right.





442
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:59,044
She took her vengeance out on the village.

443
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:04,013
Our elder chief, Taha Aki,

444
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:09,181
was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe after his son was killed.





447
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:25,027
Taha Aki's third wife
could see that he would lose.

448
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,605
The third wife was no magical being,

449
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,540
with no special powers but one,

450
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,809
courage.



452
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,557
The third wife's sacrifice
distracted the cold woman

453
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,225
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

454
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:57,067
She saved the tribe.

455
00:33:57,572 --> 00:34:00,666
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.

456
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:03,640
But one remains,

457
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,636
the cold ones.

458
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,882
Our magic awakens when they're near,

459
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:14,018
and we sense it now.

460
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:15,522
We feel the threat in our blood.

461
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:20,053
Something terrible is coming,

462
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,463
and we must all be ready,

463
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,730
all of us.







467
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,020
What did you do to me?

468
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:01,626
I'm so...

469
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:03,934
Yeah. I know.

470
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:06,854
We'll find you someone to drink.

471
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:08,309
MALE VAMPIRE: Mine!

472
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,347
Just try not to get killed, will you?

473
00:35:21,757 --> 00:35:23,816
I'm gonna need numbers.

474
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:27,424
Seattle is in a state of terror.

475
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:31,364
Police are baffled by
the escalating murders and disappearances.

476
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:35,336
Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer.

477
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,429
Reporting live...

478
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:39,805
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

479
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:44,310
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

480
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,540
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

481
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:49,983
It's newborns.

482
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:53,519
What, like new vampires?

483
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,615
In the first few months after the change.

484
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:59,287
That's when
we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

485
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:01,826
Insane with thirst.

486
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,629
Something to look forward to.

487
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:09,563
No one's trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

488
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:12,565
Someone's creating an army.

489
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:15,036
Well, now we're definitely
going to Seattle.

490
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:17,807
An army of vampires?

491
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,872
And they've been created to fight someone.

492
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,646
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

493
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,186
DR. CULLEN: Regardless of why
they were made,

494
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:26,382
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

495
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:28,516
I'm surprised they've
let it go on this long.

496
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,026
Maybe they're behind it.

497
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:33,991
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

498
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,828
He wants me and Alice to join him,

499
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,063
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

500
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:41,798
An army could solve that for him.

501
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:51,608
Hey.

502
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:54,280
Did you eat dinner yet?

503
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,882
No, I haven't.



505
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:05,491
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

506
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:10,159
and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

507
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:13,728
You think they should just give up?

508
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,370
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

509
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:23,212
Not ever.

510
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:31,454
BELLA: I have to figure out
what to tell people.

511
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:35,286
Why I won't be home for Christmases,

512
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,122
and why I won't visit,

513
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:42,290
why they'll never see me again.

514
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:46,368
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

515
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:50,438
Problem solved.

516
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,139
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

517
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:00,277
I've told you.

518
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:05,085
Be honest with me.

519
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:07,859
There's more.

520
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,788
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

521
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:19,436
I've lived through it.

522
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,935
And to let you suffer that...

523
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:29,073
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

524
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:34,177
But to risk yours,

525
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:37,347
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

526
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:41,923
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

527
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:50,326
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

528
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:57,705
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

529
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:09,081
You'll always be my Bella.

530
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,335
My Bella, just less fragile.

531
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:46,418
BELLA: Gosh, it's so pretty here.

532
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,060
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

533
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:57,296
Which you're invited to.

534
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,672
Yeah, I figured that.

535
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,580
What?

536
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:18,082
I just wanted to do this differently.

537
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:19,824
Smoother.

538
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:23,330
But now I'm out of time.

539
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:25,964
Do what?

540
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:29,464
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

541
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:32,437
understand all your options.

542
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:35,772
And you need to know

543
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:39,576
that I'm in love with you,

544
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,076
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

545
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,316
I thought you understood.

546
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,628
I don't feel that way for you.
I don't buy it.

547
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:55,596
What don't you buy?

548
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,396
That's how I feel.

549
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:02,729
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

550
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:06,041
So I'm not giving up.

551
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,969
I'm gonna fight for you

552
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,476
until your heart stops beating.

553
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:16,580
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

554
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:18,951
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

555
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:20,614
No, I'm not.

556
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,822
I know what I want.

557
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:28,288
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

558
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:31,194
or say goodbye to anybody.

559
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:34,829
I can give you more than him.

560
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,071
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

561
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,876
Feel that?

562
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,110
Flesh and blood.

563
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,479
And warmth.



565
00:42:00,297 --> 00:42:01,423
God!

566
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,328
God!

567
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:13,200
Edward!

568
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,541
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

569
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,604
Don't do this here!
She's not sure what she wants.

570
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:19,115
Don't do this here!
Let me give you a clue.

571
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:20,582
Wait for her to say the words.

572
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:22,915
Fine! And she will.

573
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,686
Jacob, just go, okay?

574
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:27,485
CHARLIE: Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

575
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:30,554
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

576
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:34,890
What's going on?

577
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:39,803
I kissed Bella.

578
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,841
And she broke her hand.

579
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:49,306
Punching my face.

580
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,915
Total misunderstanding.

581
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:56,953
DR. CULLEN: It's just a sprain.

582
00:42:57,122 --> 00:42:59,283
It should heal fairly quickly.

583
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:04,228
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

584
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:06,553
I punched a werewolf in the face.

585
00:43:06,732 --> 00:43:10,327
Bad ass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

586
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,233
Tough enough to take you on.

587
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:20,977
Don't worry about it.

588
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,841
Got any leads?

589
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:30,552
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

590
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,656
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

591
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:46,432
Okay...

592
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:48,940
Rosalie,

593
00:43:51,077 --> 00:43:53,773
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

594
00:43:54,113 --> 00:43:55,171
Hate...

595
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,410
I don't hate you.

596
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:04,454
I don't particularly like you, but...

597
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:11,121
Bella, I envy you.

598
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:13,393
What?

599
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,999
That's ridiculous.
No, it's not.

600
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:20,705
You have a choice.

601
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:22,440
I didn't.

602
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:27,005
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

603
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:31,016
I don't care
how miserable your human life is.

604
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,513
My life is not miserable.

605
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:40,956
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

606
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,827
Mine was.

607
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,430
Absolutely perfect.

608
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,066
There were things I still wanted,

609
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,760
to be married, with a nice house

610
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,034
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home,

611
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:56,534
a family of my own.

612
00:44:57,478 --> 00:45:00,845
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor
in town.

613
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:03,780
I barely knew him.

614
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:12,014
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

615
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:17,052
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

616
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,622
I wasn't far from home.

617
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,395
There she is.

618
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,492
Hey, Rose!

619
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:24,870
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

620
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,401
Hey, come over here.

621
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:30,174
We've been waiting for you.

622
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:32,740
There she is.

623
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,844
Royce. Royce!



625
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:39,048
You're drunk.

626
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,612
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

627
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,215
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

628
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:46,821
What do you say, Rose?

629
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:49,635
Why don't we take off a few layers?
Stop it, stop it.

630
00:45:49,798 --> 00:45:51,766
Stop. Stop!

631
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:55,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

632
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,001
Sober.

633
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,905
Hey, where do you think you're going?

634
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,374
I said, get... Come back... Hey!
Stop! Stop! Get off me!

635
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,411
You'll do as I say!
Let go of me! Stop!

636
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:06,812
Stop! Let go! Stop!

637
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:12,544
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

638
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:14,855
Believe me, I wanted to be.

639
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,686
Carlisle found me. He
smelled all the blood.

640
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,959
Thought he was helping me.
I'm sorry.

641
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:27,031
I got my revenge on them.

642
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,198
One at a time.

643
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:33,370
Saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.





646
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:54,327
I was a little theatrical back then.

647
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:06,107
Things got better after I found Emmett.

648
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:10,706
But we'll always be this.

649
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,611
Frozen.

650
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,277
Never moving forward.

651
00:47:20,156 --> 00:47:23,751
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.

652
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:27,653
Sitting on a front porch somewhere,

653
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:30,526
Emmett, gray-haired, by my side,

654
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,228
surrounded by our grandchildren.

655
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:36,266
Their laughter.

656
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:41,176
I understand that that's what you want.

657
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:50,986
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more

658
00:47:53,724 --> 00:47:55,316
than Edward.

659
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,994
You're wrong again.

660
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,732
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more,

661
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:05,566
one thing you'll kill for.

662
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,837
Blood.



664
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:18,776
What did I say about a low profile?



666
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:33,095
Something's coming.

667
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,296
Something bigger than any of us alone.

668
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:45,301
And if you can't control yourselves,

669
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:50,206
we're all going to die.

670
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,817
What's done is done, just

671
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,790
clean up after yourselves.

672
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,495
They've already drawn too much attention.

673
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:14,903
So has our inaction.

674
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:19,604
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

675
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:22,012
Let them.

676
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:29,714
Maybe we should consult with Aro.



678
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:37,058
Aro's decisions are being watched.

679
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:40,861
We must decide.

680
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:46,499
Then decide, sister. It's time.

681
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:50,237
Yes, it is.

682
00:49:55,148 --> 00:49:57,946
Either we let them do
what they were created for,

683
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:00,815
or we end them.

684
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:03,722
Decisions, decisions.

685
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:18,534
When we were five, they asked us
what we wanted to be when we grew up.

686
00:50:18,605 --> 00:50:22,701
Our answers were things
like astronaut, president,

687
00:50:23,343 --> 00:50:26,039
or, in my case, a princess.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

688
00:50:26,113 --> 00:50:28,741
When we were 10, they asked again.

689
00:50:28,816 --> 00:50:33,685
We answered rock star, cowboy
or, in my case, a gold medalist.

690
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:38,419
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

691
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,983
Well, how about this?

692
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,286
Who the hell knows?



694
00:50:44,565 --> 00:50:45,725
Yeah!

695
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:49,763
This isn't the time to make
hard-and-fast decisions.

696
00:50:49,837 --> 00:50:51,498
This is the time to make mistakes.

697
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:55,508
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

698
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:58,238
Fall in love a lot.

699
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:03,845
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

700
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:07,752
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing's permanent.

701
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:11,483
So make as many mistakes as you can.

702
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,656
That way, someday,
when they ask what we want to be,

703
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,495
we won't have to guess.

704
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:19,558
We'll know.





707
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:48,425
You made it!

708
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,389
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

709
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:54,436
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

710
00:51:54,503 --> 00:51:57,097
No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
JESSICA: Yeah?

711
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,704
It's like I was born to lead, right?

712
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:01,538
I love this song! Let's go.



714
00:52:26,468 --> 00:52:27,799
What are you doing here?

715
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,135
You invited me, remember?

716
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:34,842
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

717
00:52:35,678 --> 00:52:39,240
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

718
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:43,252
the kiss and your hand.

719
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:48,284
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal
thing, but it was really just me

720
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:50,620
being an ass.

721
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:52,827
I'm really sorry.

722
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:56,295
I brought you something.

723
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,865
A graduation present. I made it myself.

724
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,203
BELLA: Wow.

725
00:53:02,672 --> 00:53:03,969
You made this?

726
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:06,533
It's really pretty.

727
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,209
Thanks.

728
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:24,017
I'll be right back.

729
00:53:27,098 --> 00:53:30,295
Alice, what'd you see?
The decision's been made.

730
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:31,926
What's going on?

731
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,494
You're not going to Seattle.
No.

732
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:37,573
They're coming here.

733
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,767
ALICE: They'll be here in four days.

734
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:41,744
This could turn into a bloodbath.

735
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:42,936
Who's behind it?

736
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:45,482
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

737
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,083
Maybe one.

738
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:51,653
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

739
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,514
He didn't start this.

740
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,582
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

741
00:53:55,926 --> 00:53:58,292
They must be playing with the blind spots
in your vision.

742
00:53:58,362 --> 00:54:00,230
JASPER: Either way, the army is coming

743
00:54:00,298 --> 00:54:01,925
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

744
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,000
Hold up. What damn army?

745
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:07,037
Newborns. Our kind.

746
00:54:07,271 --> 00:54:08,397
What are they after?

747
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,539
They were passing around Bella's scent.

748
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:12,238
A red blouse.

749
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:15,678
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

750
00:54:15,747 --> 00:54:18,648
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

751
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:25,984
All right. We're in.

752
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:29,485
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

753
00:54:30,028 --> 00:54:32,292
I wasn't asking for permission.

754
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,297
Edward?

755
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:39,626
It means more protection for you.

756
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,703
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

757
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:50,074
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

758
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:51,172
DR. CULLEN: Jasper?

759
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,274
They'll give us the numbers.

760
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:58,479
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

761
00:54:58,557 --> 00:54:59,990
We'll need to coordinate.

762
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:03,892
Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
We'll all need some training.

763
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:06,932
Fighting newborns requires knowledge
that Jasper has.

764
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:09,092
You're welcome to join us.

765
00:55:10,436 --> 00:55:13,530
All right. Name the time and place.

766
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:17,440
Jake, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

767
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:20,243
Bella,

768
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:22,747
this is what we do.

769
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:24,613
You should be happy.

770
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:27,913
Look at us, working together.

771
00:55:28,388 --> 00:55:31,915
You are the one who wanted us
to get along. Remember?

772
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:42,695
Again!

773
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:58,011
It's a graduation present.



775
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:19,969
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

776
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,167
They came. That's what matters.

777
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,207
Will you translate?

778
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,547
Hey, Jake.

779
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:39,057
Welcome.

780
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:45,062
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

781
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:50,463
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

782
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,265
They're a great deal stronger than us

783
00:56:53,341 --> 00:56:56,208
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

784
00:56:56,978 --> 00:57:00,072
Our kind is never more physically powerful

785
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:02,743
than in our first several
months of this life.

786
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:10,087
Carlisle's right. That's
why they are created.

787
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:15,361
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

788
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:18,558
but no human army
could stand against them.

789
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:23,295
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

790
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:26,807
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

791
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:28,433
And second,

792
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:32,442
never go for the obvious kill.

793
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:36,179
They'll be expecting that,

794
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:39,049
and you will lose.



796
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,851
Emmett.





799
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,728
Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.







803
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,310
Never lose focus.





806
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,670
One more thing.

807
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,101
Never turn your back on your enemy.













814
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,724
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

815
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,525
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

816
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:35,735
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?



818
00:59:58,397 --> 00:59:59,864
Done for the day.

819
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,342
Jasper?

820
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:20,414
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

821
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:24,012
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

822
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:28,116
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

823
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,721
Good. I'm glad.

824
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:37,232
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

825
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:43,298
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

826
01:00:49,682 --> 01:00:52,947
Those bites are like mine.
Battle scars.

827
01:00:55,288 --> 01:00:57,950
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

828
01:00:58,024 --> 01:01:00,492
was useless against the newborns.

829
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,093
Still, I never lost a fight.

830
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:13,028
This happened during the Civil War?

831
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:15,836
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

832
01:01:15,908 --> 01:01:18,604
all without having seen any real battle.

833
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:19,838
Until?

834
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,713
Till I met a certain immortal.

835
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,117
Maria.

836
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:32,254
I was riding back to Galveston

837
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:34,953
after evacuating a column
of women and children

838
01:01:35,796 --> 01:01:36,990
when I saw them.

839
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,961
I immediately offered them my aid.

840
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:50,443
Lovely. And an officer.



842
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:02,648
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

843
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:09,924
What's your name, soldier?
Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

844
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,661
I hope you survive.

845
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:16,395
You may be of great use to me.

846
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:24,515
Maria was creating an army?
They were very common in the South.

847
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:29,277
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

848
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:31,647
Maria won them all.

849
01:02:32,854 --> 01:02:37,484
She was smart, careful, and she had me.



851
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:42,559
I was her second in command.

852
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:46,123
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

853
01:02:47,936 --> 01:02:49,403
I trained her newborns,



855
01:02:52,974 --> 01:02:57,570
an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

856
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:02,816
It was my job to dispose of them.

857
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:25,839
I could feel everything they felt.



859
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:41,551
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

860
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:46,689
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

861
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:50,765
I didn't know there was another way

862
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:54,965
till I found Alice.

863
01:03:56,772 --> 01:03:59,104
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

864
01:03:59,575 --> 01:04:01,668
You kept me waiting long enough.

865
01:04:05,615 --> 01:04:07,310
My apologies, ma'am.

866
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:11,617
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.



868
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:16,457
You never have to be that again.



870
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:45,479
Jasper.

871
01:04:46,856 --> 01:04:48,824
I want you to do something for me.

872
01:04:48,892 --> 01:04:51,191
Kill her.



874
01:05:05,676 --> 01:05:06,802
What is it?

875
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,972
The intruder,

876
01:05:13,617 --> 01:05:15,278
the newborn army,

877
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,853
they're all her puppets.

878
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:23,221
Victoria.

879
01:05:24,428 --> 01:05:27,693
Alice would have seen
if she wanted to make an army.

880
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:32,566
Unless she's hiding behind them
and she's letting someone else decide.

881
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,698
Welcome to the army.



883
01:06:12,978 --> 01:06:16,675
I'm not just gonna hide while you're
out taking all the risks for me.

884
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:20,883
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep
you as far away from the fight as possible.

885
01:06:20,952 --> 01:06:24,410
Jasper said that I could be of help.
We won't need your help.

886
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:27,322
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

887
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:30,021
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

888
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:32,462
Okay. Either it's so dangerous
that I have to hide

889
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:34,557
or it's so easy that you're gonna
be sidelined. Which is it?

890
01:06:34,634 --> 01:06:37,125
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

891
01:06:39,072 --> 01:06:43,736
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

892
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:49,510
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

893
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:53,847
Okay, you're right.

894
01:06:54,554 --> 01:06:58,115
So I'm coming with you.
No, we both stay away together.

895
01:06:58,558 --> 01:07:01,425
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

896
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:04,520
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

897
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:12,795
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

898
01:07:12,872 --> 01:07:15,272
He's doing it for me, okay?
Whatever.

899
01:07:16,642 --> 01:07:17,871
Just tell me the plan.

900
01:07:18,812 --> 01:07:20,780
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

901
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:23,646
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

902
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:26,147
but it needs to end here.

903
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,847
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

904
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:31,254
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

905
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:33,293
Your stench, however, is revolting.

906
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,487
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

907
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:39,157
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

908
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:43,059
Done.
This is not a good idea.

909
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:48,131
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

910
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:50,399
Okay. Let's just try it.

911
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,546
Eau de wolf coming up.
Run.

912
01:08:05,859 --> 01:08:08,420
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

913
01:08:08,496 --> 01:08:10,623
Or don't you care about my safety?

914
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:16,537
Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
I won't have a choice, anyways.

915
01:08:17,772 --> 01:08:22,072
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

916
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:25,211
Since you let Sam be alpha?

917
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:30,281
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

918
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:33,245
Wow.

919
01:08:34,756 --> 01:08:37,725
Chief Jacob.
Opted out.

920
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,158
But every choice has its consequences.

921
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:44,289
Some more than others.
Don't start.

922
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,768
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

923
01:08:47,835 --> 01:08:51,236
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

924
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:54,935
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

925
01:08:56,478 --> 01:09:01,415
Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
It has nothing to do with imprinting.

926
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:06,214
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

927
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:09,483
And I know you feel something for me.

928
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:13,821
I can sense how I make
you feel, physically.

929
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:17,461
I make you nervous.

930
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,998
Jake.

931
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:26,507
Don't worry.

932
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:30,810
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

933
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:35,042
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

934
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:41,580
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

935
01:09:44,828 --> 01:09:47,262
This will work.
Great.



937
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:57,033
Yes. Scout's honor.

938
01:09:57,807 --> 01:10:00,708
Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
Okay.

939
01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:04,262
Your alibi for the
battle is all arranged.

940
01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:05,427
Really?

941
01:10:05,774 --> 01:10:08,670
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

942
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:11,135
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

943
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:15,003
Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
Charlie?

944
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:19,038
You guys are on first name basis now?
Me, he likes.

945
01:10:20,764 --> 01:10:23,995
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

946
01:10:27,335 --> 01:10:28,393
Like alone?

947
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:32,680
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

948
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:36,542
You're welcome.

949
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:42,465
Hey. You want a sandwich?
No, I'm good.

950
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,607
Well, the sister, I like.

951
01:10:47,636 --> 01:10:50,537
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

952
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,546
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

953
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:05,173
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

954
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:14,361
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

955
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:18,884
Why?
I don't know.

956
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:26,421
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

957
01:11:27,441 --> 01:11:28,874
of marriage.

958
01:11:30,504 --> 01:11:32,144
But do you think there's any value in it?

959
01:11:34,495 --> 01:11:37,521
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

960
01:11:39,685 --> 01:11:41,277
When you're older.

961
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:43,676
Much older.

962
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,319
Like your mother.

963
01:11:47,729 --> 01:11:50,129
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

964
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,061
later in life.
Yeah, I guess.

965
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:59,929
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

966
01:12:01,172 --> 01:12:02,571
careful.

967
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:07,915
What?
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

968
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,631
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

969
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,347
Okay. Don't have "the
talk" with me, please.

970
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:17,937
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

971
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,212
I doubt that.

972
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:21,683
And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat
you to it like 10 years ago.

973
01:12:21,763 --> 01:12:23,663
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

974
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,202
I'm sure things work the same way.

975
01:12:28,407 --> 01:12:30,102
All right, so...

976
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:34,507
You guys are taking precautions and...

977
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,639
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

978
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:41,748
Edward is old school.

979
01:12:44,157 --> 01:12:47,752
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

980
01:12:47,783 --> 01:12:50,445
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

981
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:54,863
Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

982
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:00,742
Virgin.

983
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,708
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

984
01:13:15,512 --> 01:13:17,742
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

985
01:13:19,093 --> 01:13:20,321
Nothing.

986
01:13:40,005 --> 01:13:42,803
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

987
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:49,573
It's really pretty.

988
01:13:50,778 --> 01:13:51,836
Thanks.

989
01:14:00,072 --> 01:14:01,562
There's a bed.

990
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:05,185
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

991
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,162
I think an air mattress
would have sufficed.

992
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:13,279
Is this too much?
No.

993
01:14:14,395 --> 01:14:16,090
No, it's perfect.

994
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:21,103
I wanna ask you something.
Anything.

995
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:28,853
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

996
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:32,774
Yes.

997
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,665
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

998
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:43,187
Anything you want. It's yours.

999
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,837
You promise?

1000
01:14:48,148 --> 01:14:49,342
Yeah.

1001
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,363
Okay.

1002
01:15:01,337 --> 01:15:02,395
Hey.

1003
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:12,448
Bella.

1004
01:15:13,457 --> 01:15:14,651
No.

1005
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:17,628
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

1006
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:20,822
Not ones that will risk killing you.
You won't.

1007
01:15:22,637 --> 01:15:25,797
And everyone says once I'm changed all
I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1008
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:30,337
That part doesn't last forever.
I want you.

1009
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:37,111
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1010
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:46,943
It's too dangerous.
Try. Just try.

1011
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:53,838
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

1012
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,112
I'll marry you. Just try.















1020
01:16:37,682 --> 01:16:40,173
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

1021
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:42,913
You wanna do that part?
Not tonight.

1022
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,202
You...

1023
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:09,913
You mean, you don't...

 That's fine.

1025
01:17:16,388 --> 01:17:18,515
Believe me, I want to.

1026
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:22,626
I just want to be married to you first.

1027
01:17:25,957 --> 01:17:28,255
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1028
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:31,460
trying to steal your virtue or something.

1029
01:17:33,872 --> 01:17:36,067
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1030
01:17:38,266 --> 01:17:39,927
Are you kidding?

1031
01:17:40,462 --> 01:17:44,489
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1032
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:50,698
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1033
01:17:51,872 --> 01:17:54,569
I know that's not a modern notion.

1034
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:57,830
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1035
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,919
I'm from a different era.

1036
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,840
Things were a lot less complicated.

1037
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:15,575
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1038
01:18:17,852 --> 01:18:23,017
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1039
01:18:33,717 --> 01:18:36,083
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1040
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:42,535
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1041
01:18:44,445 --> 01:18:46,003
I would have got down on one knee,

1042
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,989
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1043
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:04,014
This was my mother's.

1044
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:13,293
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1045
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:18,128
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1046
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:25,482
Yes.



1048
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:49,435
You're not coming with us?

1049
01:19:57,956 --> 01:20:00,447
It'll be a last minute decision.

1050
01:20:02,523 --> 01:20:07,756
I told you how it works.
The Cullens have powers.

1051
01:20:08,877 --> 01:20:13,576
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1052
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:19,695
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

1053
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,913
According to your friend?
Yes.

1054
01:20:24,456 --> 01:20:27,323
My dead friend.

1055
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:33,383
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

1056
01:20:35,383 --> 01:20:37,214
and they killed him.

1057
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:41,423
But not before he told me.

1058
01:20:46,568 --> 01:20:48,399
Maybe he was wrong.

1059
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:57,867
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1060
01:20:58,964 --> 01:21:02,900
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1061
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:05,730
You don't trust me.

1062
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:11,473
With my life. I'm just saying...
I'm doing this for us.

1063
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:16,567
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1064
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:20,532
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1065
01:21:20,603 --> 01:21:22,298
I won't let them.

1066
01:21:23,473 --> 01:21:28,240
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1067
01:21:31,114 --> 01:21:32,513
I swear.

1068
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:53,032
I love you so much.

1069
01:22:13,657 --> 01:22:15,056
You're going overboard.

1070
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:18,219
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1071
01:22:18,295 --> 01:22:20,525
The new borns'll be frantic.

1072
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:26,134
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1073
01:22:26,203 --> 01:22:27,534
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1074
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,834
Since when?

1075
01:22:31,308 --> 01:22:34,334
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1076
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:38,210
You're not wearing your ring.

1077
01:22:39,717 --> 01:22:42,083
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1078
01:22:43,954 --> 01:22:45,444
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1079
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:52,595
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1080
01:22:52,664 --> 01:22:55,292
If you're having second thoughts...
I'm not.

1081
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:59,463
I just want him to have a clear head.
Whose head is unclear?

1082
01:23:01,006 --> 01:23:02,701
Nobody's I hope.

1083
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:06,677
Alice says there's a storm coming.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1084
01:23:07,913 --> 01:23:09,710
We should get going.

1085
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:13,317
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1086
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:24,061
Something up?

1087
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:30,695
Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
Same old same old.

1088
01:24:48,587 --> 01:24:49,679
Thank you.

1089
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,003
You should get back
before the storm hits.

1090
01:24:54,034 --> 01:24:55,278
No, I'm staying.

1091
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:58,815
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1092
01:24:58,846 --> 01:25:02,373
You're not gonna fight?
Seth will spell me in the morning.

1093
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:05,798
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1094
01:25:07,411 --> 01:25:08,969
Let's get you inside.



1096
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:32,487
I should have chosen a site lower down.
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1097
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,753
What can I do?



1099
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:50,807
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1100
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:02,319
Forget it.
She may need her toes someday.

1101
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:06,925
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1102
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:16,870
Get your hand off me.
Keep your hands off her.

1103
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:18,863
Don't fight.

1104
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:24,041
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1105
01:26:41,096 --> 01:26:43,291
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1106
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,858
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1107
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:51,999
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1108
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:54,737
Jake.
Survival 101.

1109
01:27:26,443 --> 01:27:29,674
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1110
01:27:32,082 --> 01:27:35,677
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1111
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:39,148
What?

1112
01:27:40,191 --> 01:27:42,853
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1113
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:46,621
Nice.

1114
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:53,101
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1115
01:27:57,108 --> 01:27:58,268
Look.

1116
01:27:59,844 --> 01:28:02,711
I know she's in love with you.
Good.

1117
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:05,713
But she's in love with me, too.

1118
01:28:07,952 --> 01:28:10,477
She just won't admit it to herself.

1119
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:15,925
I can't tell if you're right.

1120
01:28:17,395 --> 01:28:18,919
Then let me ask you something.

1121
01:28:19,997 --> 01:28:22,727
If she chooses me...
She won't.

1122
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,631
If she did,

1123
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:27,769
would you try to kill me?

1124
01:28:29,408 --> 01:28:31,501
That's an intriguing idea.

1125
01:28:36,415 --> 01:28:39,543
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1126
01:28:40,685 --> 01:28:43,449
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1127
01:28:44,256 --> 01:28:47,157
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1128
01:28:47,592 --> 01:28:50,117
So stop her.
I tried.

1129
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:54,660
I left.
But you gave up too quickly.

1130
01:28:56,601 --> 01:29:01,504
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1131
01:29:02,274 --> 01:29:03,605
Trust me.

1132
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:09,945
You have to consider that I might
be better for her than you are.

1133
01:29:12,617 --> 01:29:14,551
I have considered that.

1134
01:29:18,257 --> 01:29:20,418
I know you can protect her.

1135
01:29:23,062 --> 01:29:27,897
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1136
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:32,128
But I'm not...

1137
01:29:33,206 --> 01:29:36,471
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1138
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:42,244
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1139
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:46,984
Yeah. That I remember.

1140
01:29:51,224 --> 01:29:53,488
When you thought she was gone,

1141
01:29:55,828 --> 01:29:57,591
that you'd lost her,

1142
01:30:00,099 --> 01:30:03,000
how did you cope?

1143
01:30:05,004 --> 01:30:06,802
There are no words.

1144
01:30:12,846 --> 01:30:15,280
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1145
01:30:18,018 --> 01:30:21,545
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1146
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:23,719
Meaning,

1147
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:27,727
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1148
01:30:30,864 --> 01:30:33,162
If we weren't natural enemies

1149
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,635
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1150
01:30:38,005 --> 01:30:40,132
I might actually like you.

1151
01:30:41,174 --> 01:30:42,471
Well,

1152
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:48,242
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1153
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:50,480
I might...

1154
01:30:57,559 --> 01:31:00,619
No. Not even then.

1155
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:12,269
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1156
01:31:19,047 --> 01:31:20,412
Then I'd let her go.

1157
01:31:40,568 --> 01:31:42,160
Right. Hey, Seth.

1158
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:48,309
Where's Jacob? Did he already...
Not yet.

1159
01:31:50,179 --> 01:31:53,945
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1160
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:04,617
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1161
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:08,052
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1162
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:13,261
You have a list?
All 10 I spent with you.

1163
01:32:14,703 --> 01:32:19,072
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1164
01:32:22,911 --> 01:32:26,813
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1165
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:31,108
You're marrying him?
Jake, I...

1166
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:38,950
You knew he was listening!
He deserves to know.

1167
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:41,888
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1168
01:32:41,998 --> 01:32:43,124
Don't!

1169
01:32:46,202 --> 01:32:47,260
Jake, stop!

1170
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,398
BELLA: Jake, please!
I'm done! I'm so done!

1171
01:32:55,645 --> 01:32:56,873
What can I do?

1172
01:32:56,946 --> 01:33:01,144
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1173
01:33:01,217 --> 01:33:03,811
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1174
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,682
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1175
01:33:06,756 --> 01:33:09,190
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1176
01:33:11,094 --> 01:33:12,288
Why?

1177
01:33:14,164 --> 01:33:15,859
Give me one good reason.

1178
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,934
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1179
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:21,936
It's not good enough.

1180
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,205
Because you're too important.

1181
01:33:28,646 --> 01:33:32,138
Still not good enough.
Jacob!

1182
01:33:36,387 --> 01:33:37,649
Kiss me.

1183
01:33:41,025 --> 01:33:44,483
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1184
01:34:32,277 --> 01:34:34,905
That should have been our first kiss.

1185
01:34:40,519 --> 01:34:41,918
I gotta go.

1186
01:34:44,856 --> 01:34:46,255
I'll be back.

1187
01:35:16,489 --> 01:35:19,890
You saw.
No, but...

1188
01:35:20,893 --> 01:35:22,656
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1189
01:35:24,197 --> 01:35:25,721
I don't know what happened.

1190
01:35:27,733 --> 01:35:29,166
You love him.

1191
01:35:33,573 --> 01:35:35,370
I love you more.

1192
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:38,474
I know.





1195
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,889
It's starting.







1199
01:36:54,822 --> 01:36:56,050
Jacob just got there.

1200
01:37:02,497 --> 01:37:04,021
He's good.





1203
01:38:02,324 --> 01:38:03,450
Someone's hurt?

1204
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,886
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

1205
01:38:08,297 --> 01:38:09,525
Seth, go.

1206
01:38:14,504 --> 01:38:16,870
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1207
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,433
She knew you'd be with me.

1208
01:38:20,076 --> 01:38:21,543
She found us.

1209
01:38:25,148 --> 01:38:26,809
She's not alone.

1210
01:38:35,959 --> 01:38:38,757
Riley, listen to me.

1211
01:38:40,196 --> 01:38:43,256
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

1212
01:38:44,034 --> 01:38:45,501
She knows I'll kill you.

1213
01:38:49,172 --> 01:38:52,938
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1214
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:57,979
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1215
01:38:58,048 --> 01:39:01,882
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

1216
01:39:02,385 --> 01:39:04,047
VICTORIA: He's lying.

1217
01:39:04,121 --> 01:39:08,785
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1218
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,088
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1219
01:39:15,733 --> 01:39:19,191
There's only you. You know that.

1220
01:39:21,605 --> 01:39:25,268
Think about it. You're from Forks.

1221
01:39:27,178 --> 01:39:28,338
You know the area.

1222
01:39:29,447 --> 01:39:31,312
That's the only reason she chose you.

1223
01:39:33,017 --> 01:39:35,247
She doesn't love you.

1224
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:40,313
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1225
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,227
You know I love you.

1226
01:39:58,410 --> 01:39:59,809
You're dead.





1229
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:16,859
You won't get another chance
like this again.

1230
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:22,689
You want her.

1231
01:40:24,503 --> 01:40:27,734
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1232
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,537
when I tore him to pieces,

1233
01:40:35,046 --> 01:40:37,742
when I turned him into ash,

1234
01:40:39,918 --> 01:40:43,878
when I turned him into nothing.











1240
01:42:04,004 --> 01:42:05,164
Victoria!

1241
01:42:06,607 --> 01:42:07,801
Victoria!

1242
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:10,267
Victoria!





1245
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:07,334
Something is wrong.
Alice needs us to go.

1246
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:09,362
Now.

1247
01:43:32,394 --> 01:43:35,454
EDWARD: How long?
A few minutes. Maybe 10?

1248
01:43:35,531 --> 01:43:36,961
DR. CULLEN: The pack needs to leave.

1249
01:43:36,965 --> 01:43:39,456
The Volturi won't honor
a truce with the werewolves.



1251
01:43:46,442 --> 01:43:47,500
Leah, don't!

1252
01:44:04,794 --> 01:44:06,489
Jacob!

1253
01:44:09,866 --> 01:44:12,426
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

1254
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:14,663
The bones on the right half of his body
are shattered.

1255
01:44:16,406 --> 01:44:18,772
Bella.
Jake, I'm right here.

1256
01:44:20,777 --> 01:44:23,041
Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
Leah!

1257
01:44:23,113 --> 01:44:25,775
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1258
01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:28,147
It's already starting.
EDWARD: We need to get him out of here.

1259
01:44:28,218 --> 01:44:31,085
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1260
01:44:31,154 --> 01:44:33,884
We'll take him back to Billy's.
I'll be there soon as I can.

1261
01:44:34,424 --> 01:44:35,482
Hang in there, Jake.



1263
01:44:46,237 --> 01:44:49,001
It's okay. We got you.
We got you.

1264
01:44:49,974 --> 01:44:51,100
They're coming.

1265
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:13,925
Impressive.

1266
01:45:13,998 --> 01:45:18,560
JANE: I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

1267
01:45:18,636 --> 01:45:20,194
We were lucky.

1268
01:45:21,672 --> 01:45:23,264
I doubt that.

1269
01:45:25,176 --> 01:45:27,234
It appears we missed
an entertaining fight.

1270
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:28,664
JANE: Yes.

1271
01:45:29,168 --> 01:45:31,830
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1272
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:34,729
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would have fulfilled your purpose.

1273
01:45:36,267 --> 01:45:37,427
Pity.

1274
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:42,859
You missed one.

1275
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:52,265
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1276
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:55,410
That wasn't yours to offer.

1277
01:45:58,677 --> 01:45:59,803
Why did you come?



1279
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:07,379
Who created you?



1281
01:46:09,221 --> 01:46:11,941
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

1282
01:46:12,527 --> 01:46:13,789
I know.

1283
01:46:15,904 --> 01:46:19,772
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1284
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:22,935
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1285
01:46:22,997 --> 01:46:26,262
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1286
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:30,425
DR. CULLEN: Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1287
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:31,796
they would have stopped her.

1288
01:46:33,063 --> 01:46:34,360
Isn't that right, Jane?

1289
01:46:36,759 --> 01:46:38,249
Of course.

1290
01:46:39,698 --> 01:46:40,756
Felix.

1291
01:46:42,044 --> 01:46:43,477
She didn't know what she was doing.

1292
01:46:45,445 --> 01:46:47,777
We'll take responsibility for her.

1293
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:50,155
Give her a chance.

1294
01:46:52,816 --> 01:46:58,015
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1295
01:46:59,282 --> 01:47:02,149
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1296
01:47:02,573 --> 01:47:04,666
The date is set.

1297
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:10,613
Take care of that, Felix.
I'd like to go home.



1299
01:47:39,046 --> 01:47:40,536
Hey.
(JACOB SCREAMING)

1300
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,812
It's been going on for a while.
EMBRY: Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1301
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:51,721
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1302
01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:53,316
Give it a rest, Leah.

1303
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,732
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1304
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:03,930
I gave him some morphine,

1305
01:48:04,005 --> 01:48:06,337
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1306
01:48:06,407 --> 01:48:08,466
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1307
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:10,443
Thank you.

1308
01:48:20,388 --> 01:48:21,582
He's asking for you.

1309
01:48:36,904 --> 01:48:37,962
Hey, Jake.

1310
01:48:41,542 --> 01:48:42,804
Hey.

1311
01:48:55,691 --> 01:48:59,491
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?

1312
01:49:01,263 --> 01:49:02,855
Yeah.

1313
01:49:03,866 --> 01:49:06,664
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1314
01:49:09,338 --> 01:49:12,796
Was he hard on you?
He wasn't even mad at me.

1315
01:49:14,043 --> 01:49:15,203
Or you.

1316
01:49:16,712 --> 01:49:18,202
Well, damn.

1317
01:49:20,716 --> 01:49:24,675
He's better than I thought.
He's not playing a game.

1318
01:49:27,222 --> 01:49:28,484
Right.

1319
01:49:32,027 --> 01:49:33,324
Bella.

1320
01:49:36,632 --> 01:49:39,466
He's not as perfect as you think.

1321
01:49:43,006 --> 01:49:44,701
I know who he is.

1322
01:49:49,045 --> 01:49:51,445
Can we just not talk about that?

1323
01:49:52,649 --> 01:49:55,709
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1324
01:50:01,825 --> 01:50:04,658
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1325
01:50:08,498 --> 01:50:11,831
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1326
01:50:15,271 --> 01:50:18,297
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1327
01:50:26,516 --> 01:50:29,452
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1328
01:50:31,956 --> 01:50:36,620
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1329
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:44,931
You know I love you.

1330
01:50:51,709 --> 01:50:54,610
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1331
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:07,650
Should I come back?

1332
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:12,556
I need some time.

1333
01:51:17,269 --> 01:51:19,362
But I'll always be waiting.

1334
01:51:24,609 --> 01:51:27,407
Until my heart stops beating.

1335
01:51:29,381 --> 01:51:30,712
Maybe even then.

1336
01:51:53,805 --> 01:51:58,105
August 13th?
Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1337
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:01,804
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1338
01:52:02,614 --> 01:52:04,734
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1339
01:52:05,518 --> 01:52:07,213
I'm sure she can.

1340
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:11,250
There's no rush.

1341
01:52:13,826 --> 01:52:17,023
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1342
01:52:17,997 --> 01:52:21,455
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1343
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:26,295
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1344
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:29,170
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1345
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:32,735
Does it matter?

1346
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,284
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1347
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:42,549
What? The wedding?
No.

1348
01:52:45,524 --> 01:52:48,357
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1349
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:51,855
but you're already giving
away too much.

1350
01:52:52,798 --> 01:52:54,289
You're wrong.

1351
01:53:02,309 --> 01:53:05,676
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1352
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:13,612
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1353
01:53:17,324 --> 01:53:22,318
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1354
01:53:25,499 --> 01:53:27,399
I've never felt normal.

1355
01:53:29,937 --> 01:53:31,871
Because I'm not normal.

1356
01:53:33,106 --> 01:53:34,767
I don't want to be.

1357
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:41,509
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1358
01:53:42,884 --> 01:53:46,047
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1359
01:53:48,723 --> 01:53:52,056
and more real, more myself.

1360
01:53:54,796 --> 01:53:56,957
Because it's my world, too.

1361
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:01,964
It's where I belong.

1362
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,971
So it's not just about me?

1363
01:54:13,214 --> 01:54:16,240
No. Sorry.

1364
01:54:18,619 --> 01:54:23,682
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1365
01:54:25,059 --> 01:54:29,462
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1366
01:54:33,802 --> 01:54:35,360
Starting with a wedding.

1367
01:54:39,641 --> 01:54:41,040
Actually,

1368
01:54:41,944 --> 01:54:46,904
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1369
01:54:52,654 --> 01:54:54,087
We have to tell Charlie.

1370
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,522
It's highly dangerous.

1371
01:55:00,596 --> 01:55:02,757
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1372
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,357
I'm gonna need that ring.
