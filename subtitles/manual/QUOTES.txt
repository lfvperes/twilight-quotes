#TWILIGHT




I’d never given much thought to how I would die...But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go. So I can’t bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die.


Mom, I want to go. I’ll be fine.


Glad you’re finally here. Charlie hasn’t shut up about it since you told him you were coming. 


I’m Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids.


You’re Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I’m Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on. 


I’m kind of the “suffer in silence” type.


So, you’re from Arizona, right? Aren’t people supposed to be tan down there?


Because they’re all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett... they’re a thing. I’m not even sure that’s legal.


He’s totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care. Anyway, don’t waste your time.


Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won’t die.


There must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem?


No, every class is full. I’m afraid you’ll have to stay in biology. I’m so sorry.


I’ll just... endure it. 


I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom’s not great in the kitchen. 


Just ‘cause they’re newcomers. We’re lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren’t like a lot of the hell-raisers around here.


Ok, I didn’t lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now.


Now, tell me more about your school, baby. What are the kids like? Are there any cute guys? Are they being nice to you?

Ice doesn’t help the uncoordinated.


I’ll be late for dinner. I’m heading down to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal.


Come on, Arizona. Give it up for the rain. 


I didn’t have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.  


Onion root tip cells! That’s what’s on your slides. Separate and label them into the phases of mitosis. The first partners to get it right, win... the golden onion! 


Seriously? You’re asking me about the weather?


If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S.


I’m just trying to figure you out. You’re very hard to read.


Did you get contacts? Your eyes were black before, now they’re this golden brown or –


It’s just the fluorescents.


Bells. Are you alright? 


You can kiss your license goodbye. 


You have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion.


It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn’t knocked me out of the way. It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me. 


You were next to your car, across the lot.


You stopped that van. You pushed it away. 


Can't you just thank me and get over it?


Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.


You haven’t answered any of mine. You won’t even say hello.


Hello.


And how did you stop that van?


Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.


I know I’ve been rude, but it’s for the best.


Bella, look! It’s a worm! It’s a worm!


Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.


You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.


You think I regret saving you? 


She always did know how to worry. But... she’s changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right. 


La Push, baby. You in?


La Push, baby.


I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.


It means if you were smart, you’d avoid me.


So let’s say, for argument’s sake, that I’m not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?


Okay... how ‘bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite? 


You’re talking about superheroes. What if I’m not a hero? What if I’m a bad guy?


No. I don’t believe that. You’re not bad. You can be a jerk, but it’s like this... mask. To keep people away.


The Cullens don't come here.


You want to go look at tide pools?


So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here? 


Oops. Caught that, huh?


It’s just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?


Well, they’re supposedly descended from this, like... “enemy clan.” ... But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them.


The question should be, “will it hurt?” 


Whenever the weather’s nice, the Cullens disappear.


I think this halter makes my boobs look big. What do you think, Bella?


I should go back and rip their heads off.


You don’t know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.


That’s so... thoughtful.


I’m on a special diet.


Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.


I didn’t ask for the square root of pi.


Were you following me?


I feel very protective of you.


Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help.


You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking... Can you... read minds?


Alright, so you read minds... What am I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go. 


I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours. 


Money, sex, money, sex…cat.


I tell you I read minds and you think there’s something wrong with you? 


I... don’t have the strength to stay away from you anymore.  


Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place. I just examined the body.


Bella, you should go inside. Waylon was your father’s friend.


You’re impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white and ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like...like you’re from a different time. You never eat or drink anything, you don’t go out in the sunlight. How old are you?


How long have you been seventeen?


I know what you are.


Say it. Out loud. Say it.


Are you afraid?


Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat? 


I’m not afraid.  


Beautiful? This is the skin of a killer, Bella.


I’m designed to kill.


I’ve killed people. 


I wanted to kill you.


And so the lion fell for the lamb.


Stupid lamb.


Sick masochistic lion.


About three things I was absolutly positive of. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally, irrevocably in love with him.


Does someone have to be dying to become like you?...


I don’t want to be a monster. 


We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn’t very satisfying. 


You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you? 


Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.


Is she even Italian?


Here comes the human.


Bella. We’re making Italiano for you. 


You’ve given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.  


Yeah, it’s just…because I know…I know you guys don’t eat, so…


Yes, let’s keep pretending this isn’t dangerous for all of us.


Badly. As in…I…I become a meal.


I’m Alice. You do smell good.  


It’s alright, Bella and I are going to be great friends.


Graduation caps? 


No bed?


Everybody’s staring.


Gambling, tuxedos and Bond. James Bond.


Not that guy... No wait, he just looked


I’m breaking all the rules now, anyway. Since I’m going to hell.


Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.


I’ve never minded being alone. Guess I’m a lot like my dad that way. 


I’m stronger than I thought.


Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I’m Edward.


Bella’s going to play baseball? 


She thinks we cheat. 


________________


It’s time.


Edward’s very fast. 


Could you use three more players?


Our apologies. We didn’t realize the territory had been claimed. 


You brought a snack. 


And if I don’t get out now, I’m going get stuck here like mom did.


His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.


I’ve grown tired of his games. But he’s got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I’ve never seen anything like him in three hundred years ... And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don’t underestimate her.


Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you’ve inflicted on us.


You're my life now.


Bella? Bella? Where are you? 


I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well.


I can’t bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with death... they also brought me to Edward.


Mom, I suck.


So to make things more entertaining, I’m going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don’t mind. 


Edward has nothing to do with this. 


It’s burning!


Stop. Her blood is clean, you’re killing her.


Death is peaceful. Easy. Life... is harder...  


I dream about being with you forever.  


You’re going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn’t that enough?












#NEW MOON






These violent delights have violent ends…


Happy birthday, Bells.


Dad, we agreed, no gifts.


I need a picture. My mom's expecting a scrapbook full of memories.


Maybe I should be creeped out that I'm dating such an old guy.


God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge.


How come Jacob Black gets to give you  a gift and I don't?


Vampires. You can't trust them.


Not the girl - the suicide. Nearly impossible for my kind. But humans, a little poison, dagger to the heart. There are so many options.


There are... ways for us. At least one way. I would have gone to Italy, provoked the Volturi…


Francesco Solimena painted this; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods.


Yes. He lived with them for a few decades. He describes them as very refined - for killers.


Dating an older woman. Hot.


No hating on the truck.


Ouch - paper cut.


It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.


Then you and I agree. But Edward doesn't believe there's an afterlife for our kind. He thinks we've lost our souls.


Stop. I don't want normal, I want you.


You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age... as long  as I'm human…


That's your solution?   My ending your life?


I'll leave my window open for you.


Then... can I ask for one thing? It's still my birthday. Kiss me?


We have to leave Forks.


Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing.


Okay, I…I gotta think of something to tell Charlie.


Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing.


You’re right. That was nothing. Nothing but what I’ve always expected. And nothing compared to what could’ve happened. You just don't belong in my world, Bella.


I don't want you to come.


You don't... want me.


Don't do anything reckless... for Charlie's sake.


And I promise something to you in return. This is the last time you’ll ever see me. I won’t come back.


If this is about my soul, take it! I don't want it without you --


You're just not good for me.


It will be like I never existed, I promise.


He's... gone.


When you left…when he left…you took everything with you. But the absence of him is everywhere I look. It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest. But in a way, I’m glad. The pain is my only reminder that he was real…that you all were.


That's it.You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.


Kind of? I mean, at first I was worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's still bumming? It's not like I wasn't going through things, too. Like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends?" That was really hard and –


Turn around, Bella. This is dangerous.


I can break promises, too.


So, what, you're like an adrenaline  junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie- jumping. Don't be a complete freak.


Bella! Where the hell have you been, loca?


Oh it's totally stupid and reckless. When do we start?


I said she's a girl and a friend.


They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.


He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them. Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out. 


My dad's been getting reports at the sheriff's station. A couple hikers went missing. People are scared.


Slowly... release the clutch.


You're apologizing for bleeding?


Just, you're actually... good looking.


How hard did you hit your head?


Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me.


Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono. He won't let me visit but... would you call me?


Jacob. Please. Call me.


Laurent?


I went to visit the Cullens, but their house is empty. I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?


Lie.


Lie better.


Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.


No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm doing you a kindness. Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully - whereas I'll make it very quick.


Edward. I love you.


Wolves. They're wolves, Dad.


You cut your hair.


Go home, Bella. Don't come back.


So you're the vampire girl.


You... killed Laurent?


You won't stay with me any other way.


What the hell were you thinking?


Must be nice, never getting cold.


It's a Jacob thing. You're just... warm.


I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too late but -- Why the hell would you try to kill yourself?!


I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell?


He's not here. He's at a funeral.


Bella, he's going to Italy... to the Volturi.


But I still love him, and I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.


Please, Bella. Stay here. For Charlie... for me.


I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy. But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us. We'd be delighted to utilize your skills.


Such a waste.


Hope you're not opposed to grand theft auto.


He's waiting till noon, when the sun's at its highest.


He'll be under the clock tower!


Heaven...


I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.


What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful?


It will happen, Aro. See for yourself.


I'll be here when you wake up.


You... think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?


I went to them because I thought I'd lost you.


Just... don't ever do that to me again. Okay? And you're grounded for the rest of your life.


He won't forgive me easily.


You all know what Edward wants. And you know what I want. But I won't force myself on you. I think the only fair way to handle this is by vote.


I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to want to kill you.


This isn't the life I'd have chosen for myself. I wish there'd been someone to vote no for me... So... no.


Why are you so willing to give up your soul?


Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't.


If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.


Please don't make me choose. Because it'll be him. It's always been him.


You’re so stubborn


I have one condition…if you want me to do it myself.


And then forever.


Marry me, Bella.
