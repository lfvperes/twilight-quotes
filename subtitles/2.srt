1
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:01,653
BELLA: "These violent delights
have violent ends,

2
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,220
"and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

3
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:10,794
"which, as they kiss, consume."







7
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:47,296
Gran?



9
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,284
Edward, don't! She'll see you.

10
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,317
Hmm.

11
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,193
Okay.

12
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,742
(IN BELLA'S VOICE)
Gran, I'd like you to meet...



14
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,108
Happy birthday, Bella.





17
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,515
Happy birthday.



19
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,921
I thought we agreed, no presents.

20
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:26,560
Well, the one from me's not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

21
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:33,034
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

22
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:37,310
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

23
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,639
Well, she coordinated me.

24
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,975
It's to put your pictures in
from senior year.

 Senior year.

26
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,288
- How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't. It's not that old.

27
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,156
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

28
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,265
No. No way.



30
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:03,963
Happy birthday.

31
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,473
That's really funny.

32
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,945
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: Another missing
hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.

33
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,741
Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...





36
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:16,981
Situation's all critical

37
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:20,921
You've got to look first before you go

38
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,890
ERIC: It's Bella. Bella!

39
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,816
- Hi.
- MIKE: I'm...

40
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,122
JESSICA: Today's the big day, Bella.

41
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:31,795
R and J essay due.

42
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:35,264
- Oh, yeah.
- Wherefore art thou, Bella?



44
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,273
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,

45
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,469
a scrapbook full of memories.

46
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,533
ERIC: Oh.
MIKE: Cool. Yeah.

47
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:43,977
I take them. I'm not in them.

48
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,445
- No, no, no, come here.
- BELLA: Well, you are today.

49
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,879
You'll photoshop this
if my nose looks big, right?

50
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,783
ERIC: Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

51
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,252
BELLA: That's good.

52
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:55,014
Oh, good. Cullen's here.



54
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,052
Well, talk to you later.

55
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,780
- Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

56
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:25,843
EDWARD: Mmm.

57
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,116
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

58
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,888
- Yeah, but my aging's not.
- Your aging?



60
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,029
I think 18 is a little young
to start worrying about that.

61
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,727
It's one year older than you.

62
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:42,327
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

63
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:45,768
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating
such an old man.

64
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:49,402
- Mmm.
- It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

65
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:50,467
Uh-huh.



67
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:03,657
- We have to go to class.
- Okay.



69
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,955
Wait a second.

70
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,629
Someone wants you.

71
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:15,236
- JACOB: Bella!
- Jacob!

72
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,999
What?

73
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,833
I'll leave you to talk.

74
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,813
Hello, biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.



76
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:32,283
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

77
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:35,791
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

78
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,193
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

79
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,697
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

80
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:45,800
They let any old riffraff into this place.

81
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,961
- I see. Then why are you slumming it?
- Mmm-hmm.

82
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,528
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

83
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:53,131
You should really come
take a ride when it's done.

84
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,574
Is it fast?

85
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,699
Um.

86
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:57,604
It's decent.



88
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,045
- I'm kidding.
- Okay. Good.

89
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,877
Hey, happy birthday.

90
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,615
Your dad told my dad, so...

91
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:10,225
Yeah, of course he did.

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,354
I saw this the other day
and thought of you.

93
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,727
Catches bad dreams.

94
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,759
That's kind of perfect.

95
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,337
Thank you.

96
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,340
No problem.

97
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,703
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

98
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:30,905
Bye.

99
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:36,078
So how come Jacob Black
gets to give you a gift and I don't?

100
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:40,154
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

101
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,657
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.



103
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,220
See? Thank you.

104
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,890
- That's all I want.
- ALICE: Bella!

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,765
- Happy birthday!
- Shh, shh!



107
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:57,565
I thought I said no presents.

108
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,801
I've already seen you open it,
and guess what,

109
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,308
you love it.

110
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,175
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

111
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,907
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

112
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,921
- Okay. All right.
- Great!

113
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,117
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

114
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,264
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.



116
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:26,292
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

117
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,001
Never mind.

118
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:34,572
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

119
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:37,603
ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love! My wife!

120
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,609
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath

121
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:43,117
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

122
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:46,151
Thou art not conquered.

123
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:51,525
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

124
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,228
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

125
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:57,265
BELLA: I hate being celebrated.

126
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,902
EDWARD: There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.

127
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,939
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

128
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:06,933
BELLA: Yeah.

129
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:09,604
Though I do envy him one thing.

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,539
BELLA: Juliet is, like, perfect.

131
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:16,881
If you like
that obviously beautiful sort of thing.



133
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:23,090
Not the girl, the suicide.

134
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,259
It's nearly impossible for...

135
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,361
For some people.

136
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:39,269
For humans, a little poison,

137
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:43,368
a dagger to the heart.

138
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,240
There's so many different options.

139
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,419
Why would you say that?

140
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,213
Because I had to consider it once.



142
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,452
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

143
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:04,259
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

144
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,229
What was the plan?

145
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:10,761
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

146
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,837
- The what?
- The Volturi.

147
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:17,367
MR. BERTY: Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter

148
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:20,006
just to show they were paying attention?

149
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,815
Mr. Cullen?



151
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:26,480
Yes, Mr. Berty.

152
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:33,092
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

153
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:39,261
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

154
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,967
"Eyes, look your last.

155
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,835
"Arms, take your last embrace!

156
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,709
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

157
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:53,712
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless
bargain to engrossing death!"

158
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,044
Eyes on the screen, people.

159
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,054
ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die.

160
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:08,625
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

161
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,860
I guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

162
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,664
- Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:19,067
He lived with them for a few decades.

164
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,737
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,

165
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,116
but a respect for the arts and the sciences,
at least.

166
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,175
And the law.

167
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:33,950
Above all, the law.

168
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,955
BELLA: Vampires have laws?

169
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,123
EDWARD: Not very many.

170
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,131
And only one that's regularly enforced.

171
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,104
BELLA: What is it?

172
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:54,267
EDWARD: That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

173
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,770
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

174
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:02,173
and we don't kill conspicuously.

175
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,556
Unless, of course, you want to die.



177
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,063
You gotta stop talking about that.

178
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,906
I can't even think
about someone hurting you.

179
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:35,574
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me
is you.

180
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,444
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

181
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:41,580
That's not true.

182
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,789
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

183
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,224
Alice will see when she decides,
and we'll be ready.

184
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,401
I could protect you

185
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,133
if you change me.

186
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,240
Bella, you already do protect me.

187
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:04,202
You're my only reason

188
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,611
to stay alive,

189
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,114
if that's what I am.

190
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,752
But it's my job to protect you.



192
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:21,421
From everyone except my sister.

193
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,728
It's time! It's time. It's time. It's time!



195
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,231
Your lips are nettles

196
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,364
Your tongue is wine

197
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,435
You're left as liquid
But your body's pine

198
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,206
DR. CULLEN: Sorry about all this.

199
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,112
- We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.

200
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:42,673
- Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.

201
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:48,623
I found it in your bag. You mind?

202
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,622
Dating an older woman. Hot.



204
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:56,059
- What?
- You first, Rosalie.

205
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,994
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

206
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,631
Thanks.

207
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,070
Show me the love.

208
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,771
This one's from Emmett.

209
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,742
Already installed it in your truck.

210
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,254
Finally a decent sound system

211
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:22,722
- for that piece of...
- Hey! Don't hate the truck.



213
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:26,053
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

214
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,854
DR. CULLEN: Just a little something
to brighten your day.

215
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:32,901
Yes, you've been looking
kind of pale lately.

216
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,162
Ow.

217
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,240
Paper cut.





220
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:10,062
Jaz, Jaz. It's okay. It's just a little

221
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:13,805
blood.





224
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,215
DR. CULLEN: Get Jasper out of here.



226
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:30,254
I'm sorry, I can't.

227
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,359
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

228
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,258
Check on Jasper.

229
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,535
I'm sure he's very upset with himself,

230
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:45,130
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

231
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,401
Edward.



233
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:01,345
BELLA: I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN: It's not your fault.

234
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:07,555
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

235
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,924
How do you do it?

236
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,026
Years and years of practice.

237
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:17,436
Did you ever think
of just doing it the easy way?

238
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,332
No.

239
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,946
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

240
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:29,447
It brings me happiness,
even if I am damned regardless.

241
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:33,285
Damned?

242
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,986
Like hell?

243
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:45,866
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

244
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:48,532
You couldn't. It's impossible.

245
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,698
Thank you, Bella.

246
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:54,868
You've always been very gracious about us.

247
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:02,212
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

248
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:07,687
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

249
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:12,192
If you believed as Edward does,

250
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:15,792
could you take away his soul?

251
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:40,852
You can't protect me

252
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,619
from everything.

253
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:48,062
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

254
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,393
It's gonna be an accident or illness

255
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:54,967
or old age,

256
00:17:56,738 --> 00:18:01,107
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.

257
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,342
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

258
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:10,044
You're not gonna want me
when I look like a grandmother.

259
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:23,564
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you at all?

260
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:28,064
Carlisle told me

261
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:33,300
how you feel about your soul.

262
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,707
I don't believe that.

263
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,006
So don't worry about mine.

264
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,980
You should go inside.

265
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:59,633
It's still my birthday.

266
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,262
So can I ask one thing?

267
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,072
Kiss me?





270
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,875
I love you.

271
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,879
I love you.



273
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:18,007
Up with your turret

274
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:24,241
Aren't we just terrified?

275
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:39,423
Shale, screen your worry

276
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:44,495
From what you won't ever find

277
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:57,318
Don't let it fool you

278
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,183
Don't let it fool you

279
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,883
Down

280
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:09,991
Hey.

281
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:16,336
Just come take a walk with me.

282
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,062
We have to leave Forks.

283
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,527
Why?

284
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:53,629
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older
than he looks,

285
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,108
and people are starting to notice.

286
00:21:58,813 --> 00:22:02,772
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say
to Charlie.

287
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,460
When you say "we"...

288
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:22,965
I mean my family and myself.

289
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:30,703
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

290
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,742
You're right. It was nothing,

291
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:38,876
nothing but what I always expected

292
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,086
and nothing compared
to what could have happened.

293
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:52,929
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

294
00:22:58,006 --> 00:22:59,701
I belong with you.

295
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,775
No. You don't.

296
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,748
I'm coming.

297
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:09,977
Bella,

298
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,718
I don't want you to come.



300
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:23,025
You don't want me?

301
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,896
No.

302
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:37,011
That changes things a lot.

303
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,948
But if it's not too much to ask,

304
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,185
can you just promise me something?

305
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,750
Don't do anything reckless.

306
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:54,290
For Charlie's sake.

307
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,699
And I'll promise
something to you in return.

308
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,634
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

309
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:03,829
I won't come back,

310
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:08,233
and you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

311
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,810
It will be like I never existed, I promise.

312
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:20,017
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.

313
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,113
It's not about your soul.

314
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:27,558
You're just not good for me.

315
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:31,132
Not good enough for you.

316
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,995
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.



318
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,202
Please...

319
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,038
Don't...

320
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,678
Goodbye.



322
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,525
Edward.

323
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:18,506
Edward.

324
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,145
Edward.

325
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:28,452
Edward!

326
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:37,625
Edward.









331
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,943
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.

332
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:39,745
- BILLY: The Cullens left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance.

333
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,516
Where'd they go?

334
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,423
We'll find her, Charlie.

335
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:46,824
- Thanks, Harry.
- Charlie!

336
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,187
BILLY: Hey.

337
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:53,058
She's all right.

338
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:57,393
I got her. Thank you, Sam.



340
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,510
There's a possibility

341
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:52,187
There's a possibility

342
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:58,658
All that I had

343
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:02,328
Was all I'm gonna get

344
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,675
BELLA: Alice, you've disappeared,

345
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:15,249
like everything else.

346
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:19,213
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

347
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:27,921
When you left,

348
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,492
and he left,

349
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:36,101
you took everything with you.

350
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:41,232
But the absence of him
is everywhere I look.

351
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:52,143
It's like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest.



353
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,851
Bella.





356
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:17,010
BELLA: But in a way I'm glad.

357
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,637
The pain is my only reminder
that he was real,

358
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:22,406
that you all were.

359
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:33,319
All right. That's it.

360
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:37,189
What?

361
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:40,931
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

362
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:45,205
I'm not leaving Forks.

363
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:50,374
Bells, he's not coming back.

364
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,709
I know.

365
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,783
It's just not normal, this behavior.

366
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:03,287
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me
and your mother.

367
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,258
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

368
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:12,396
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

369
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,127
I like my old friends.

370
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:16,966
- Well, you never see them anymore.
- I do.

371
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:24,702
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow
with Jessica.

372
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,708
- You hate shopping.
- I...

373
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:32,578
I need a girls' night out.

374
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,221
All right. Girls' night.

375
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:40,958
Shopping.

376
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:45,459
I like it. Go buy some stuff.



378
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,832
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

379
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,943
Yeah, Bella Swan.

380
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,418
JESSICA: I don't know why you want to
sit through

381
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:08,785
all those zombies eating people
and no hot guys kissing anybody.

382
00:32:08,856 --> 00:32:12,383
It's gross. Like... And why are there
that many zombie movies anyway?

383
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,054
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,

384
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:18,121
my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?

385
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:21,100
And, like, is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

386
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:23,363
Because don't be so pleased
with your own, like,

387
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:26,065
self-referential cleverness, you know?

388
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,632
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

389
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,702
Although I was surprised
you even called at all. You know?

390
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,908
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.

391
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:37,007
But after a while it's like,

392
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,574
- you're still bumming...
- CHET: You want a ride, girls?

393
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:40,644
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding

394
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,779
he just wants to be friends.

395
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:42,845
CHET: What's up? Look what we found.

396
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:44,118
JESSICA: It's hard, you know?

397
00:32:44,191 --> 00:32:45,522
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

398
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,117
BIKER 1: What's up guys?
BIKER 2: Look what we found.

399
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:49,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?



401
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,327
Keep walking.



403
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,102
This is dangerous.

404
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,215
- Dude, come on.
- CHET: Come here for a sec!

405
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,419
I think I know those guys.

406
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:23,321
CHET: We got beer! We got bikes!

407
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:26,489
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

408
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:29,733
I'm just gonna see something.

409
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:32,271
CHET: Hey, girlie!

410
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:39,373
All right, all right. We got a taker.

411
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:41,514
Turn around.





414
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,561
BIKER 2: Shut up!
BIKER 3: You shut up!

415
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,099
I'm sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

416
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:09,006
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

417
00:34:09,076 --> 00:34:11,738
So, what do you say?

418
00:34:16,317 --> 00:34:18,911
You promised me, nothing reckless.



420
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:26,054
You promised it would be
as if you never existed.



422
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:34,329
- You lied.
- You say something, babe?

423
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:35,892
You know what? Never mind.



425
00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:55,682
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!



427
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,601
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

428
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:10,364
Just curious.

429
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,774
- I thought that I saw something.
- You... Oh.

430
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:18,475
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

431
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:21,573
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

432
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:26,018
I was about to end up in an FBI
interview room like some lame TV show.

433
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,379
God, that was such a rush.

434
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,651
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

435
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:33,988
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

436
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:37,326
You don't get on the back
of some random loser's motorcycle.

437
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:38,558
Crazy.

438
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,732
BELLA: Alice, I saw him.

439
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:50,641
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

440
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,045
If a rush of danger
is what it takes to see him,

441
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:58,347
then that's what I'll find.

442
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:03,616
Bella!

443
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,785
Where the hell have you been, loca?



 I brought you something.

446
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:16,562
- Okay.
- It's a little crazy.

447
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:22,700
Wow.

448
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,305
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

449
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:27,609
I saved it from the junkyard.



451
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,718
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth,

452
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:36,252
but then I thought that
if I had a mechanic friend

453
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:37,585
- to help me out then...
- Ah!

454
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:41,025
- Me being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

455
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:45,222
- Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.

456
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:54,506
I get it if you think that
this is really stupid and reckless.

457
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:57,601
Yeah, I mean,
it's completely stupid and reckless.

458
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:02,241
When do we start?

459
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:05,507
Um.

460
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,650
Now.

461
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:10,286
- Please?
- (CHUCKLES) All right.

462
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,060
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...

463
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:24,667
Jake, you're, like, buff.

464
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,002
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

465
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:30,407
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

466
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,046
It feels like that sometimes.





469
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:49,957
That song's good. You don't like it?

470
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:55,467
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

471
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:58,627
Okay. No more music.

472
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:03,902
So I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this every day,

473
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:05,843
and hopefully we will,

474
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:08,643
we have to, like,
fit some homework in there somewhere.

475
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:11,776
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

476
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:14,946
You? Influence me? Please.

477
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:19,849
Are you... I'm older than you,

478
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:23,294
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influencee.

 No, no, no.

480
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:28,763
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you

481
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,361
because of your general paleness
and lack of know-how.

482
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:33,929
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

483
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:37,569
Don't you think that makes you
kind of young and naive?

484
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:39,875
Okay. So where do we stand?

485
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:43,850
- I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32.
- Come on.



487
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,614
- QUIL: Yo, Jake, you in there?
- It's okay. It's just my boys.

488
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:51,487
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

489
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,083
- Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
- Hi.

490
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:56,525
I'm Quil Ateara.

491
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:00,566
So the bike building story is true.

492
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:02,727
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I taught him everything he knows.

493
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:05,601
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

494
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:07,230
Uh...

495
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:09,139
We're friends, you know.

496
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,870
- (LAUGHS) Burn.
- Actually,

497
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:13,845
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

498
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:15,779
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

499
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:16,838
Nope.

500
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,408
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.



502
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:24,181
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

503
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:26,019
Yeah, that's still a riot.

504
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:29,062
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.



506
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:31,695
Jeez.

507
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,096
JACOB: Hey, that hold's illegal!

508
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,158
EMBRY: I got five bucks on Quil.

509
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:36,867
You're on.



511
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:43,400
All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups

512
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:47,777
Waiting for the big hero to show

513
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:52,908
Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands

514
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:56,215
And his heart in his throat

515
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,316
What can he tell them now

516
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,922
BELLA: Dear Alice,

517
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,360
I wish I had your real address.

518
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:06,357
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

519
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:08,828
He makes me feel better.

520
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:12,437
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

521
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:17,135
The hole in my chest,

522
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:22,238
well, when I'm with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed

523
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:24,715
for a while.

524
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:29,285
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

525
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:30,812
Oh.

526
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:35,458
Well, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?



528
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:39,655
What's up with you and age?

529
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,102
I mean,
how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

530
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:48,573
BELLA: But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.





533
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:58,945
Hey, hey, hey!

534
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:00,847
Wake up, Bella.

 You're okay. You're okay.

536
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:19,105
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.



538
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,538
Can I ask you something?

539
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:31,450
Hanging out with Jacob,

540
00:41:32,352 --> 00:41:36,083
that seems to take your mind
off things a bit, doesn't it?

541
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:42,891
You know, sometimes

542
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:47,926
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

543
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,667
You know what I mean?

544
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:55,232
Of course, what do I know?

545
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,873
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

546
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,171
Famous ladies' man.

547
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:05,843
Okay.

548
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:09,346
I'm gonna go to bed.

549
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:11,046
Uh...

550
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:12,991
I love you.

551
00:42:19,132 --> 00:42:23,660
If I told you I couldn't have fixed
these bikes, what would you have said?

552
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:28,507
Are you doubting your mad skills?

553
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:32,543
No. Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.

554
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,913
It's just,

555
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:40,651
maybe if I was smart,
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

556
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:49,843
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,

557
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:53,731
but that we're just gonna
have to find something else to do.



559
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:00,635
Is that Sam Uley?

560
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:04,008
Yeah. Him and his cult.





563
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,347
Oh, my God.

564
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:13,113
Did you see that?



566
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:22,726
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

567
00:43:22,796 --> 00:43:25,287
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

568
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:31,435
- A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

569
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:34,804
We leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

570
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:40,309
You have some kind of beef with him
or something?

571
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,005
I don't know.

572
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,643
They just think they run this place.

573
00:43:46,086 --> 00:43:48,987
Embry used to call them
hall monitors on steroids.

574
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:51,490
- Now look at him.
- That's Embry?



576
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,658
- Yeah.
- What happened to him?

577
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:57,721
He missed some school.

578
00:43:57,798 --> 00:44:01,894
Now all of a sudden, he started
following Sam around like a little puppy.

579
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:04,802
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

580
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:07,570
Sam keeps giving me this look,

581
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:12,373
like he's waiting for me or something.

582
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:16,377
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

583
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,850
Well, you should just avoid him.

584
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:22,218
I try.

585
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,670
Okay.

586
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:45,870
- You look scared.
- I'm not.

587
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:48,644
All right.

588
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:50,706
- Brake?
- That one.

589
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:55,452
Clutch?

590
00:44:55,522 --> 00:44:56,716
Good.

591
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,182
Gas?



593
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:01,956
Ready?

594
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:06,157
Now, slowly release the clutch.

595
00:45:08,168 --> 00:45:09,362
EDWARD: Bella.

596
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:13,928
Stop.



598
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:16,798
Whoa!

599
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:20,838
You all right?

600
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:23,912
I'm gonna go again.

601
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,511
Okay.



603
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:40,088
Ah!

604
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:42,557
Whoa!

605
00:45:44,271 --> 00:45:45,795
Hit the brake!



607
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:01,411
I wanna go again.

608
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,217
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

609
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,850
- No. I want to go again.
- No. Forget it.

610
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,287
No more bikes.

611
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,787
Man, your head.

612
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:12,420
Ow.

613
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:16,097
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

614
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:20,000
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

615
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:23,939
Yeah. I guess I am.

616
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,712
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

617
00:46:32,986 --> 00:46:34,248
There.

618
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:42,886
What are you staring at?

619
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:48,393
You're sort of beautiful.

620
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:58,608
How hard did you hit your head?

621
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,104
I don't know.



623
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:04,882
Let's go.

624
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:09,788
ANGELA: I did see something in the woods.

625
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:11,722
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

626
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,090
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.



628
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:19,522
ANGELA: No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.

629
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,432
On all fours, it was still
taller than a person.

630
00:47:22,502 --> 00:47:23,696
A bear, maybe?

631
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,238
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.



633
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,632
ANGELA: Well, I saw it.

634
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:32,402
You know, you're not the only one.

635
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:35,875
My dad's been getting
reports at the station.

636
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:38,884
Like, five hikers have been killed
by some bear.

637
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:41,079
But they can't find the bear.

638
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:42,143
Hmm.



640
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:47,124
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

641
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:48,850
MIKE: Um...



643
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:52,698
So? I mean,

644
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,160
Bella's back?



646
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:00,564
Yeah, I guess so.

647
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,200
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

648
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,305
So, listen, now that you're talking

649
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:13,479
and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

650
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:19,821
I was just wondering if you wanted to go
see a movie with me.

651
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:26,492
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do.

652
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:29,630
Cool.

653
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:32,194
Let me see, we could check out

654
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:35,036
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

655
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:38,236
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

656
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:41,144
- I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
- No. No romance.

657
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:48,278
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?

658
00:48:49,155 --> 00:48:51,555
I mean, that's an action movie.

659
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,456
Yeah, that's perfect.

660
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,124
Guns, adrenaline.

661
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,225
That's my thing.

662
00:48:58,298 --> 00:48:59,458
Okay.

663
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:04,167
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

664
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,465
ERIC: Face Punch, yeah!

665
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:07,028
Mike, hey,
we were supposed to watch that.

666
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:08,665
Remember, the trailer's like...

667
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,972
- "Punch faces."
- I remember.

 Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.

669
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:18,848
JACOB: So Face Punch, huh?

670
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:21,511
You like action movies?

671
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:23,912
Not really.



673
00:49:26,893 --> 00:49:29,657
I heard it sucks. Bad.

674
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:34,065
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

675
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:36,764
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

676
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:38,804
Right, yeah, well,
she's buying my ticket for me.

677
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,806
She's buying it. Okay.

678
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:44,877
Jessica bailed,
and Angela got the stomach flu,

679
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:47,209
so Eric's taking care of her.

680
00:49:48,214 --> 00:49:50,341
- It's just us three.
- Great!

681
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:52,975
- Great.
- Yeah.



683
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:57,487
MAN 1 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down.

684
00:49:57,557 --> 00:50:00,253
MAN 2 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down
or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.

685
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:02,795
MAN 3 ON SCREEN: Both of you put both
of your guns down

686
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:05,592
or I'm gonna blow both
of your frickin' heads off.

687
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,467
MAN 1 ON SCREEN: All right, forget it,
let's do this!









692
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,411
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.



694
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:36,925
He's...

 What a marshmallow!

696
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:43,691
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

697
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,228
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

698
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:49,138
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.



700
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:55,780
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

701
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,451
What? I can't hold your hand?

702
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,546
No, of course you can.

703
00:51:06,393 --> 00:51:10,420
I just think it means, you know,
something a little different to you. So...

704
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:16,033
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

705
00:51:20,874 --> 00:51:23,536
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?

 Jacob, please, don't do this.



708
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:36,113
Why?

709
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:42,357
Because you're about to ruin everything.

710
00:51:44,197 --> 00:51:46,825
And I need you.



712
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,208
Well, I've got loads of time.

713
00:51:57,343 --> 00:51:59,243
I'm not gonna give up.

714
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,974
I don't want you to,

715
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:08,448
but it's just 'cause I don't want you
to go anywhere.

716
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,254
And that's really selfish.

717
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:19,994
You know,
I'm not like a car that you can fix up.

718
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:28,164
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

719
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,840
It's because of him, right?



721
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:44,384
Look,

722
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:48,459
I know what he did to you.

723
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:54,061
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.

724
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,966
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

725
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:03,374
I won't let you down.

726
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:06,244
You can count on me.

727
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,076
MIKE: Well,





730
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:22,222
I need to go home.

731
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,236
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?



733
00:53:35,475 --> 00:53:36,806
What is your problem?

734
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:39,140
Right now? You're my problem.

735
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:43,145
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

736
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:46,115
You want me to put you in the hospital?

737
00:53:46,186 --> 00:53:49,519
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

738
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:52,551
You're really hot.

739
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:57,392
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

740
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,696
I don't know what's happening.



742
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:04,159
I gotta go.

743
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,937
That dude is weird.

744
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,176
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake,
your dad says you have mono.

745
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,913
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

746
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:29,087
Hey, it's me again. I just...

747
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:33,064
I'm sorry about what I said
at the movie theater.

748
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:37,364
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

749
00:54:40,473 --> 00:54:41,906
Jacob, please...

750
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:45,242
Call me.

751
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:47,939
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.



753
00:54:54,988 --> 00:54:56,148
Hey.

754
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,081
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.

755
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:00,591
Yes, you do.

756
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,588
Yeah, you do.
Go. What are you talking about?

757
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:05,358
Just be careful.

758
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:06,864
Always am.

759
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:11,059
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

760
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:13,128
My kung fu is strong.

761
00:55:46,372 --> 00:55:47,532
Jake!

762
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:49,803
Hey!

763
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:56,581
You cut your hair off?

764
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:01,250
And got a tattoo?

765
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,818
Bella.

766
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:08,861
I thought you were too sick to come outside

767
00:56:09,796 --> 00:56:12,492
or pick up the phone when I call.

768
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:15,064
Go away.

769
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:17,562
What?

770
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:20,569
Go away.

771
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:24,737
What happened to you? What's...

772
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:27,075
Hey! What happened?

773
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:33,109
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

774
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:36,485
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

775
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,058
But if you want somebody to blame,

776
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:44,162
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
you love, the Cullens?



778
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:52,497
I don't know what you're talking about.

779
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:55,302
No, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

780
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:58,139
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

781
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:02,471
But you can't lie to me.

782
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,744
- Not anymore, Bella.
- SAM: Jacob!

783
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:07,750
Jacob!

784
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:15,283
Look, Bella,

785
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:18,861
we can't be friends anymore.

 Look, Jake,
I know that I've been hurting you.

787
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:28,197
It's killing me. It kills me.

788
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:33,274
I just need... Maybe give me, like,

789
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:35,371
- some time or something.
- Look, don't.

790
00:57:36,315 --> 00:57:37,839
It's not you.

791
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:43,654
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

792
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,922
It's true. It is me.

793
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:51,989
I'm not good.

794
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:57,998
I used to be a good kid.

795
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:00,737
Not anymore.

796
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:04,502
This doesn't even matter. All right?

797
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:05,800
This is over.

798
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:08,039
You can't break up with me.

799
00:58:09,982 --> 00:58:11,244
I mean...

800
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:14,882
I mean, you're my best friend.

801
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,153
You promised me.

802
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:21,957
I know.

803
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:25,525
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

804
00:58:26,365 --> 00:58:28,925
And this is me keeping that promise.

805
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:31,033
Go home

806
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:35,207
and don't come back
or you're gonna get hurt.

807
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:50,052
BELLA: Alice,

808
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,580
things are...

809
00:58:54,227 --> 00:58:56,127
Things are bad again.

810
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,424
Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.

811
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:06,067
I don't see Edward anymore.

812
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,441
Will it really feel like he never existed?

813
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,113
I will find the place
where I can see him again.



815
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:17,603
Bella.

816
01:00:18,644 --> 01:00:19,906
Laurent.

817
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:24,405
I didn't expect to find you here.

818
01:00:26,552 --> 01:00:30,852
I went to visit the Cullens,
but the house is empty.

819
01:00:33,192 --> 01:00:35,717
I'm surprised they left you behind.

820
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:37,919
Weren't you sort of

821
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:40,657
a pet of theirs?

822
01:00:41,634 --> 01:00:43,192
Yeah. You could say that.

823
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:45,601
Do the Cullens visit often?

824
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:51,799
Lie.



826
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,678
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

827
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:00,342
Lie better.

828
01:01:00,419 --> 01:01:03,013
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

829
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:05,818
But I probably shouldn't

830
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,954
tell Edward,

831
01:01:10,763 --> 01:01:12,128
'cause he's pretty protective.

832
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:14,393
But he's far away, isn't he?

833
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,066
Why are you here?

834
01:01:19,138 --> 01:01:23,507
I came as a favor to Victoria.

835
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:28,503
- Victoria?
- She asked me to see

836
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:32,210
if you were still under
the protection of the Cullens.

837
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:35,685
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate,

838
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:37,917
given he killed hers.

839
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,753
An eye for an eye.

840
01:01:40,426 --> 01:01:41,620
Threaten him.

841
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:45,186
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

842
01:01:46,232 --> 01:01:48,166
I don't think he will.

843
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:52,337
After all, how much could you mean to him

844
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:55,263
if he left you here unprotected?



846
01:01:57,643 --> 01:02:00,635
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you,

847
01:02:00,713 --> 01:02:02,704
but I can't help myself.

848
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,778
You are so mouth-watering.

849
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,581
- Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
- No, no, no, no.



851
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:13,020
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.

 Victoria plans on killing you
slowly,

853
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:18,594
painfully,

854
01:02:19,565 --> 01:02:21,795
whereas I'll make it quick.

855
01:02:22,168 --> 01:02:23,533
I promise.

856
01:02:24,537 --> 01:02:26,528
You will feel nothing.

857
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:33,905
Edward, I love you.



859
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:37,977
I don't believe it.













866
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:47,577
- Dad! I saw them.
- What's the matter?

867
01:03:47,653 --> 01:03:50,679
- In the woods. They're not bears.
- What do you mean "in the woods"?

868
01:03:50,756 --> 01:03:52,485
Bell, what the hell
were you doing out in the woods?

869
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:56,289
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.

870
01:03:56,362 --> 01:03:58,227
Are you sure about that, Bella?

871
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:01,528
Yeah! I just saw them.
They were after something.



873
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:03,929
Wolves?

874
01:04:05,104 --> 01:04:06,571
You saw them?

875
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,768
All right, well, Harry,

876
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:16,378
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

877
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:18,874
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

878
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:22,484
BELLA: By now, those wolves will be dead,

879
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:27,149
and Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.

880
01:04:27,226 --> 01:04:28,488
Victoria.

881
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:31,719
I should go to the station.

882
01:04:31,797 --> 01:04:34,231
Yeah, you should. You should go.

883
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:37,233
CHARLIE: Can you just stay in the house?







887
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:03,523
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella!

888
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:07,631
You scared me.

889
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,158
- What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.



891
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:24,609
Hey.

892
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:28,480
Look, I'm sorry.

893
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,859
- For what?
- I wish I could explain.

894
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:41,093
But I literally can't.



896
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:53,209
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone,

897
01:05:54,146 --> 01:05:56,614
one that wasn't yours to share?

898
01:05:59,518 --> 01:06:02,043
Well, that's what it's like for me.

899
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:03,652
But worse.

900
01:06:05,024 --> 01:06:08,425
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.

901
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:11,028
I hate this.

902
01:06:11,964 --> 01:06:13,955
I hate what they've done to you.

903
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:31,507
I mean, the killer part is,
you already know.

904
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:40,320
Bella, do you remember
when we walked on the beach at La Push?

905
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,157
The...

906
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,828
The story. The story about

907
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:52,763
the cold ones.

908
01:06:54,506 --> 01:06:58,237
I guess I understand
why that's the only part you remember.

909
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,118
There's gotta be something that you can do.

910
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:11,213
No. I'm in it for life.

911
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:15,286
Well, maybe we should just
get out of here for a while.

912
01:07:15,361 --> 01:07:17,226
Just leave,

913
01:07:17,296 --> 01:07:18,923
just you and me.

914
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:20,957
You'd do that?

915
01:07:24,103 --> 01:07:26,071
I would do it for you.

916
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:35,711
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

917
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:40,140
But I would run away with you

918
01:07:44,423 --> 01:07:45,822
if I could.

919
01:07:49,962 --> 01:07:53,193
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.

920
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:58,836
Come here.

 Please,

922
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:07,241
try to remember.

923
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,974
It'd be so much easier

924
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:13,809
if you knew.

925
01:08:16,288 --> 01:08:18,779
I'll try. But, Jake...

926
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:22,321
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.



928
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:30,628
Jake.



930
01:08:47,519 --> 01:08:49,282
Edward, I'm scared.

931
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:51,482
You should be.

932
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:58,496
JACOB: Really, it's just like an old story.

933
01:08:58,564 --> 01:09:00,429
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

934
01:09:00,499 --> 01:09:04,299
Did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?



936
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:20,379
Bella?

937
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,548
I need to see him.

938
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:24,812
He's not in.

939
01:09:26,492 --> 01:09:29,791
- Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!

940
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,438
What did you do?

941
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:49,471
- Okay, what did you do?
- Hey.

942
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:50,947
- What did you do to him?
- Easy!

943
01:09:51,016 --> 01:09:52,074
He didn't want this.

944
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:54,517
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

945
01:09:54,586 --> 01:09:56,019
- Both of you calm down.
- Nothing.

946
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:59,182
He tells me nothing
because he's scared of you.



948
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,263
- Too late now.
- SAM: Bella, get back!



950
01:10:07,432 --> 01:10:10,162
SAM: Paul, calm down, now!

951
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,038
Bella!

952
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,406
Run!

953
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:26,982
Jake, run!







957
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:54,338
SAM: Paul!

958
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,652
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

959
01:11:09,361 --> 01:11:11,761
EMBRY: Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

960
01:11:16,768 --> 01:11:20,636
BELLA: Alice, is it possible that everything
is true?

961
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,740
The fairy tales and horror stories?

962
01:11:23,809 --> 01:11:27,370
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane or normal at all?



964
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:31,448
Hey, I think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

965
01:11:31,516 --> 01:11:34,178
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

966
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,050
No way. Jacob's a natural.

967
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:39,852
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

968
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,359
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

969
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:44,491
Speak for yourself.



971
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:47,655
I done me wrong

972
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:49,928
And done all wrong

973
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:54,128
All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite long

974
01:11:54,206 --> 01:11:58,802
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fianc¨¦e?
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

975
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,141
Why would I stare?

976
01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:06,343
Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask.



978
01:12:13,759 --> 01:12:15,351
Who's this?

979
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:17,258
JARED: Bella Swan. Who else?

980
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,954
Hmm.

981
01:12:20,032 --> 01:12:22,296
So, you're the vampire girl.

982
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:27,396
So, you're the wolf girl.

983
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:31,708
Guess so.

984
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:34,337
Well, I'm engaged to one.

985
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:42,211
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

986
01:12:43,255 --> 01:12:44,745
Sure. Thanks.

987
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:48,315
Leave it to Jacob to find a way
around Sam's gag order.

988
01:12:49,094 --> 01:12:51,062
He didn't say anything to me.

989
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:52,289
That's a wolf thing.

990
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:54,855
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want them to or not.

991
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:57,197
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

992
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:01,137
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

993
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,772
This chick runs with vampires.

994
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:07,370
You can't really run with vampires.



996
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,213
'Cause they're fast.

997
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:14,214
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

998
01:13:15,654 --> 01:13:17,281
Freaked out yet?

999
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,424
You're not the first monsters I've met.

1000
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:24,326
SAM: Jake's right. You're good with weird.

1001
01:13:26,098 --> 01:13:27,258
Hey.



1003
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:48,016
Sorry.

1004
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:04,332
So you're a werewolf?

1005
01:14:06,138 --> 01:14:08,538
Yeah. Last time I checked.

1006
01:14:10,776 --> 01:14:13,870
A few lucky members
of the tribe have the gene.

1007
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:18,047
A bloodsucker moves into town
and the fever sets in.

1008
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:21,711
Mono.

1009
01:14:23,455 --> 01:14:24,979
Yeah. I wish.

1010
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,321
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

1011
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:36,857
I mean, it's wrong.

1012
01:14:39,471 --> 01:14:41,996
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

1013
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:45,137
I was born this way. I can't help it.

1014
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:48,407
You're such a hypocrite. What,
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

1015
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,380
It's not what you are.

1016
01:14:50,816 --> 01:14:54,183
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

1017
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,054
You've killed people, Jake.

1018
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,523
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

1019
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:03,993
Then who is?

1020
01:15:04,062 --> 01:15:07,031
What we're trying
to protect you people from,

1021
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:09,426
the only thing we do kill,

1022
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:13,100
vampires.

1023
01:15:14,606 --> 01:15:15,664
Wait, Jake, you can't.

1024
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,004
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens

1025
01:15:18,076 --> 01:15:20,544
unless they violate the treaty.

1026
01:15:21,112 --> 01:15:23,273
That's not what I'm saying.

1027
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:26,108
You can't kill vampires. They'II...

1028
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:28,246
They'll kill you.

1029
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,856
Really? We took out that leech
with the dreads easy enough.



1031
01:15:36,294 --> 01:15:37,420
Laurent?

1032
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:40,158
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

1033
01:15:40,599 --> 01:15:41,998
Victoria's here?

1034
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:45,093
Was. We chased her all the way
to the Canadian border the other night.

1035
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:48,606
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

1036
01:15:48,673 --> 01:15:50,004
I do.

1037
01:15:53,378 --> 01:15:54,504
Me.

1038
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:06,455
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

1039
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,593
She won't get near you or Charlie.

1040
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:11,890
Look, you've got to be careful.

1041
01:16:11,963 --> 01:16:15,091
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

1042
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:19,034
You know, your lack of confidence in us
is a little insulting.

1043
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:22,404
All right, I'd better go.

1044
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:25,333
You gotta go?

1045
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:27,404
Yeah.

1046
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:30,273
Got a vampire to kill.

1047
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:46,454
BELLA: Alice, I'm all right.

1048
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:49,896
Until I'm alone.

1049
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:53,636
And lately, that's all the time.

1050
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,768
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

1051
01:16:56,841 --> 01:16:59,105
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

1052
01:16:59,177 --> 01:17:00,872
And you're gone.

1053
01:17:01,846 --> 01:17:03,609
And so is Edward.

1054
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:09,985
And there's just nothing now.

1055
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:15,049
You got something, Harry?

1056
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,888
Nope. Nothing.

1057
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,504
But I realize where I have to go,

1058
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:30,097
what I have to do to see him again.



1060
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,445
A tear in my brain

1061
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:53,523
Allows the voices in

1062
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:03,237
They wanna push you off the path

1063
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,471
With their frequency wires

1064
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:22,587
And you can do no wrong

1065
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,697
In my eyes

1066
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:35,462
In my eyes

1067
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:41,168
You can do no wrong

1068
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:49,944
In my eyes

1069
01:18:51,756 --> 01:18:54,122
In my eyes

1070
01:18:56,094 --> 01:18:58,153
A drunken salesman

1071
01:18:58,229 --> 01:19:00,163
Your hearing damage

1072
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,131
Your mind is restless

1073
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,293
They say you're getting better

1074
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:07,600
But you don't feel any better

1075
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:16,772
Your speakers are blowing

1076
01:19:16,848 --> 01:19:18,941
Your ears are wrecking

1077
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:20,917
Your hearing damage

1078
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:23,180
You wish you felt better

1079
01:19:23,254 --> 01:19:25,518
You wish you felt better

1080
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:37,329
You can do no wrong

1081
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:46,375
In my eyes

1082
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:49,203
In my eyes

1083
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,545
In my eyes



1085
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:29,610
EDWARD: Don't do this.

1086
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:36,686
You wanted me to be human.

1087
01:20:39,197 --> 01:20:40,528
Watch me.

1088
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,598
EDWARD: Please.

1089
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:46,894
For me.

1090
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:49,633
You won't stay with me any other way.

1091
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:54,243
Bella, please.





1094
01:21:56,741 --> 01:22:03,169
This constant noise all the time

1095
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:19,530
Even though you're the only one I see

1096
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,729
JACOB: Breathe!

1097
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,528
Breathe!

1098
01:22:28,206 --> 01:22:30,231
Come on, Bella, breathe!



1100
01:22:37,315 --> 01:22:39,943
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

1101
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:47,656
Jake?

1102
01:22:49,093 --> 01:22:50,492
Come here.

1103
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,266
What the hell were you thinking?

1104
01:22:59,404 --> 01:23:01,599
I just wanted to see something.

1105
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,671
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.

1106
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,805
What happened at Harry's?

1107
01:23:11,082 --> 01:23:13,744
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

1108
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:16,979
Charlie and my dad
are over at his place with his family.

1109
01:23:17,055 --> 01:23:18,545
Is he okay?

1110
01:23:20,758 --> 01:23:22,089
He's gone.

1111
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:29,324
Come on. I'll get you something dry
and drive you home.



1113
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:43,071
108 degrees over here.

1114
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,177
God!

1115
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,252
My hands are freezing.

1116
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:53,949
It must be nice, never getting cold.

1117
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:55,987
It's a wolf thing.

1118
01:23:56,794 --> 01:23:58,125
It's not.

1119
01:23:58,763 --> 01:24:00,594
It's a Jacob thing.

1120
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:02,963
You're just warm.

1121
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:07,304
You're like your own sun.

1122
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:14,572
This is better, now that you know about me.

1123
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:19,143
But...

1124
01:24:24,422 --> 01:24:26,788
You saw what happened to Emily.

1125
01:24:30,128 --> 01:24:31,720
Sam got angry.

1126
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:34,858
Lost it for a split second.

1127
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:38,360
Em was standing too close.

1128
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:43,502
He'll never be able to take that back.

1129
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:48,135
What if I got mad at you?



1131
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,057
Sometimes,

1132
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:06,188
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

1133
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,034
Okay, not that you need me

1134
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:18,005
to tell you something like this,

1135
01:25:19,644 --> 01:25:23,239
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

1136
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:28,311
I wouldn't let that happen.

1137
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:31,816
How?

1138
01:25:35,293 --> 01:25:37,591
I'll tell you all the time

1139
01:25:41,232 --> 01:25:43,223
how special you are.



1141
01:26:02,687 --> 01:26:04,917
Thank you. For everything.

1142
01:26:11,963 --> 01:26:13,123
Wait.

1143
01:26:15,933 --> 01:26:17,628
There's a vampire.

1144
01:26:18,069 --> 01:26:19,798
How do you know?

1145
01:26:20,037 --> 01:26:23,063
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.

1146
01:26:23,908 --> 01:26:25,466
That's Carlisle's car.

1147
01:26:27,011 --> 01:26:28,501
They're here.

1148
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,407
Bella, it's a trick! Stop!
You gotta come with me!



1150
01:26:35,987 --> 01:26:37,614
They won't hurt me.

1151
01:26:37,688 --> 01:26:41,089
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

1152
01:26:41,526 --> 01:26:43,926
Treaty says we can only defend
on our own lands.

1153
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:48,056
- I can't protect you here.
- Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1154
01:26:50,568 --> 01:26:52,331
You're about to cross a line.

1155
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:54,337
Then don't draw one.

1156
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:55,901
Please?



1158
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:14,017
Alice?

1159
01:27:14,325 --> 01:27:16,885
- Oh, my God! What are you...
- Bella!

1160
01:27:17,528 --> 01:27:21,726
I'm sorry, I just,
I can't believe you're here. Is...

1161
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:25,098
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

1162
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:26,860
What?

1163
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:30,135
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.

1164
01:27:31,075 --> 01:27:33,202
Why in the hell
would you try and kill yourself?

1165
01:27:33,277 --> 01:27:34,437
I mean, what about Charlie?

1166
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:37,276
- What about...
- I didn't try to kill myself.

1167
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:38,815
I was cliff jumping.

1168
01:27:38,883 --> 01:27:40,646
Recreationally.

1169
01:27:40,718 --> 01:27:42,117
It was fun.



1171
01:27:44,622 --> 01:27:48,353
I have never met anyone
more prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1172
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:54,956
Does...

1173
01:27:55,533 --> 01:27:57,592
Did you tell him?

1174
01:27:57,668 --> 01:27:58,726
No.

1175
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:03,134
He only calls in once every few months.

1176
01:28:04,742 --> 01:28:07,006
He said he wants to be alone.

1177
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:16,217
Bella, what is that
God-awful wet dog smell?

1178
01:28:17,655 --> 01:28:18,644
Um...

1179
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:21,253
That's probably me.

1180
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,524
Or it's Jacob.

1181
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:27,162
Jacob who?

1182
01:28:28,499 --> 01:28:30,626
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1183
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:35,364
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1184
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:38,506
Speak for yourself.

1185
01:28:43,381 --> 01:28:45,542
I had to see you were safe.

1186
01:28:47,084 --> 01:28:49,848
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

1187
01:28:50,121 --> 01:28:51,884
Guess I don't care.

1188
01:28:55,593 --> 01:28:57,857
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

1189
01:28:59,463 --> 01:29:01,397
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1190
01:29:01,465 --> 01:29:04,901
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1191
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:06,027
Victoria?

1192
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:08,230
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1193
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,069
I didn't see her.

1194
01:29:10,574 --> 01:29:14,101
I didn't see you
get pulled out of the water, either.

1195
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:17,981
I can't see past you
and your pack of mutts.

1196
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:20,310
Don't get me upset...

1197
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:24,548
- Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1198
01:29:29,827 --> 01:29:31,761
I'll give you a minute.

1199
01:29:37,768 --> 01:29:38,826
Hey.

1200
01:29:39,904 --> 01:29:42,532
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,

1201
01:29:42,606 --> 01:29:45,370
- right?
- As soon as you put the dog out.

1202
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:55,750
Is he...

1203
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:01,448
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here

1204
01:30:01,525 --> 01:30:03,720
and how long are they staying?

1205
01:30:03,794 --> 01:30:04,886
No.

1206
01:30:05,796 --> 01:30:07,525
It's just Alice.

1207
01:30:12,169 --> 01:30:14,967
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1208
01:30:17,408 --> 01:30:19,740
Well, are the rest coming back?

1209
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:27,108
No.

1210
01:30:28,986 --> 01:30:30,419
Not that I know of.



1212
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:33,147
Anything else?

1213
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:38,793
That's it.

1214
01:30:40,998 --> 01:30:44,661
Well, if that's all,
then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1215
01:30:47,738 --> 01:30:49,535
I've done it again.

1216
01:30:50,508 --> 01:30:52,669
I keep breaking my promise.

1217
01:30:57,915 --> 01:31:00,679
We don't have to do this to each other.

1218
01:31:05,122 --> 01:31:06,680
Yes, we do.

 Bella...





1222
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,352
Swan residence.



1224
01:31:50,134 --> 01:31:52,227
He's not here right now.

1225
01:31:52,937 --> 01:31:54,837
He's arranging a funeral.



1227
01:32:10,788 --> 01:32:12,415
Who was that?

1228
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:13,748
What?

1229
01:32:13,824 --> 01:32:15,621
Always in the way.

1230
01:32:17,795 --> 01:32:18,989
Who was that?

1231
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:20,724
Bella, step back.

1232
01:32:20,798 --> 01:32:23,995
- Jake, who was that?
- Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1233
01:32:24,602 --> 01:32:28,003
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.

1234
01:32:30,207 --> 01:32:32,937
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1235
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,204
- He didn't ask for you.
- Bella.

1236
01:32:34,278 --> 01:32:37,839
- I don't care!
- Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1237
01:32:38,516 --> 01:32:40,416
He wants to die, too.

1238
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:45,481
JACOB: He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1239
01:32:45,556 --> 01:32:49,014
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself
out of guilt.

1240
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:51,558
What about your dad?

1241
01:32:52,129 --> 01:32:55,496
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.

1242
01:32:57,268 --> 01:32:58,997
Please, Bella,

1243
01:33:00,437 --> 01:33:02,530
just stay here.

1244
01:33:04,308 --> 01:33:05,798
For Charlie.

1245
01:33:08,612 --> 01:33:10,170
Or for me.

1246
01:33:11,215 --> 01:33:12,739
I have to go.

1247
01:33:18,722 --> 01:33:20,451
I'm begging you.

1248
01:33:23,127 --> 01:33:24,526
Please.

1249
01:33:26,263 --> 01:33:27,890
Goodbye, Jacob.

1250
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:37,601
Okay.





1253
01:34:39,069 --> 01:34:41,401
So you've made up your minds.

1254
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,107
I'm afraid your particular gifts

1255
01:34:45,242 --> 01:34:47,574
are too valuable to destroy.

1256
01:34:48,512 --> 01:34:53,381
But if you're unhappy with your lot,
join us.

1257
01:34:54,518 --> 01:34:58,249
We would be delighted to utilize
your skills.

1258
01:34:59,189 --> 01:35:01,749
Won't you consider staying with us?

1259
01:35:03,527 --> 01:35:05,893
You know it will happen anyway.

1260
01:35:05,963 --> 01:35:07,863
Not without cause.

1261
01:35:12,136 --> 01:35:13,694
Such a waste.

1262
01:35:20,911 --> 01:35:22,742
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1263
01:35:22,813 --> 01:35:24,872
I figured you wouldn't be opposed
to grand theft auto.

1264
01:35:24,948 --> 01:35:26,313
Not today.

1265
01:35:29,653 --> 01:35:31,314
What? What do you see?

1266
01:35:31,388 --> 01:35:33,288
They refused him.

1267
01:35:33,357 --> 01:35:35,791
- So?
- He's gonna make a scene.

1268
01:35:36,126 --> 01:35:38,924
- Show himself to the humans.
- No! When?

1269
01:35:39,997 --> 01:35:43,023
ALICE: He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.



1271
01:35:45,803 --> 01:35:46,997
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1272
01:35:47,071 --> 01:35:48,971
There's Volterra.









1277
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:16,564
- Why are they all in red?
- San Marco's Day festival.

1278
01:36:16,633 --> 01:36:19,466
They're commemorating
the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1279
01:36:19,536 --> 01:36:20,867
It's the perfect setting.

1280
01:36:20,938 --> 01:36:23,598
The Volturi will never let him get far enough
to reveal himself.

 We have five minutes.

1282
01:36:25,475 --> 01:36:27,739
I know, Bella, just breathe.



1284
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:34,740
Alice!

1285
01:36:34,818 --> 01:36:37,013
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1286
01:36:37,087 --> 01:36:40,147
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it.

1287
01:36:40,924 --> 01:36:44,257
- Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower. Go!





1290
01:38:36,707 --> 01:38:38,038
Don't!



1292
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,270
Heaven.

1293
01:38:41,345 --> 01:38:43,006
You have to move.

1294
01:38:43,847 --> 01:38:46,611
Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive.

1295
01:38:47,384 --> 01:38:49,113
You have to move.

1296
01:38:49,987 --> 01:38:51,215
Bella.

1297
01:38:58,695 --> 01:39:00,788
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1298
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:04,861
You're alive.

1299
01:39:08,338 --> 01:39:09,532
Yes.

1300
01:39:18,982 --> 01:39:21,576
I needed to make you see me once.

1301
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:23,916
You had to know that I was alive,

1302
01:39:23,987 --> 01:39:27,115
that you didn't have
to feel guilty about anything.

1303
01:39:29,993 --> 01:39:32,587
I can let you go now.

1304
01:39:37,367 --> 01:39:39,528
I never acted out of guilt.

1305
01:39:41,972 --> 01:39:45,464
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1306
01:39:46,877 --> 01:39:48,902
- But you said...
- I lied.

1307
01:39:49,613 --> 01:39:52,707
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.

1308
01:39:58,355 --> 01:40:01,950
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1309
01:40:04,661 --> 01:40:08,256
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human. I'm nothing.

1310
01:40:09,466 --> 01:40:13,027
Bella, you're everything to me.

1311
01:40:15,005 --> 01:40:16,700
You're everything.



1313
01:40:42,432 --> 01:40:44,525
I won't be needing your services after all,
gentlemen.

1314
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:46,694
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1315
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:47,998
No rules were broken.

1316
01:40:48,071 --> 01:40:52,269
Nonetheless, we should take this
conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1317
01:40:52,342 --> 01:40:53,604
Fine.

1318
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:57,277
Bella, why don't you go
and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1319
01:40:57,347 --> 01:40:58,712
The girl comes with us.

1320
01:40:58,782 --> 01:41:00,477
No. You can go to hell.



1322
01:41:02,853 --> 01:41:04,445
Come on, guys.

1323
01:41:04,688 --> 01:41:08,089
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1324
01:41:08,925 --> 01:41:10,358
We wouldn't.

1325
01:41:10,727 --> 01:41:12,058
Enough.

1326
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:14,756
Jane.

1327
01:41:15,565 --> 01:41:18,557
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1328
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:28,578
Just do as she says.

1329
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:42,523
Go ahead.

1330
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:48,191
Don't be scared.

1331
01:41:49,132 --> 01:41:50,463
Are you?

1332
01:41:51,435 --> 01:41:52,527
No.







1336
01:42:31,108 --> 01:42:33,235
- Is she human?
- Yes.

1337
01:42:36,413 --> 01:42:38,040
Does she know?

1338
01:42:38,515 --> 01:42:39,675
Yes.

1339
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,813
Then, why would...

1340
01:42:43,453 --> 01:42:45,250
She wants to be.

1341
01:42:45,722 --> 01:42:47,121
And so she will be.

1342
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:48,623
Or dessert.

1343
01:42:57,134 --> 01:43:00,934
ALEC: Sister. They send you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1344
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:03,138
And a half.

1345
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:05,706
Such a clever girl.

1346
01:43:05,775 --> 01:43:07,675
What a happy surprise!

1347
01:43:08,745 --> 01:43:11,373
Bella is alive after all.

1348
01:43:12,282 --> 01:43:14,944
Isn't that wonderful?

1349
01:43:16,052 --> 01:43:17,952
I love a happy ending.

1350
01:43:19,055 --> 01:43:20,044
ARO: Ah.



1352
01:43:22,392 --> 01:43:24,223
They are so rare.





1355
01:43:31,067 --> 01:43:33,592
Her blood appeals to you so much

1356
01:43:34,871 --> 01:43:36,702
it makes me thirsty.

1357
01:43:36,973 --> 01:43:39,737
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1358
01:43:39,943 --> 01:43:42,935
- It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.



1360
01:43:46,349 --> 01:43:49,910
Aro can read every thought
I've ever had with one touch.

1361
01:43:50,954 --> 01:43:53,149
And now you know everything.

1362
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,553
So get on with it.

1363
01:43:58,695 --> 01:44:01,892
You are quite a soul reader yourself,
Edward.

1364
01:44:03,533 --> 01:44:07,799
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1365
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:12,675
Fascinating.

1366
01:44:16,213 --> 01:44:21,883
I would love to see
if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

1367
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:26,448
Would you do me the honor?

1368
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:48,743
Interesting.

1369
01:44:49,112 --> 01:44:50,101
Hmm.

1370
01:44:50,914 --> 01:44:52,506
I see nothing.

1371
01:45:01,858 --> 01:45:03,382
I wonder if...

1372
01:45:04,227 --> 01:45:07,196
Let us see if she's immune
to all our powers.

1373
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:10,232
Shall we, Jane?

1374
01:45:12,102 --> 01:45:13,831
- No!
- Pain.



1376
01:45:29,886 --> 01:45:31,217
BELLA: Stop!

1377
01:45:32,055 --> 01:45:33,784
Stop! Please! Stop!

 Stop! Just stop hurting him!
Please! Please!

1379
01:45:39,429 --> 01:45:40,657
Jane?

1380
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:43,755
Master?



1382
01:45:48,338 --> 01:45:50,067
Go ahead, my dear.

1383
01:45:55,578 --> 01:45:57,773
This may hurt just a little.



1385
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,397
Remarkable!

1386
01:46:17,634 --> 01:46:19,864
She confounds us all.

1387
01:46:20,904 --> 01:46:24,101
So what do we do with you now?

1388
01:46:24,641 --> 01:46:27,735
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1389
01:46:28,745 --> 01:46:30,610
She knows too much.

1390
01:46:31,147 --> 01:46:32,910
She's a liability.

1391
01:46:34,284 --> 01:46:35,273
Hmm.

1392
01:46:36,886 --> 01:46:38,444
That's true.

1393
01:46:42,325 --> 01:46:43,587
Felix?

1394
01:46:47,497 --> 01:46:48,555
EDWARD: No!



1396
01:47:50,126 --> 01:47:53,220
Please! No! No! Please, please!

1397
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:59,227
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1398
01:48:10,246 --> 01:48:12,771
How extraordinary.

1399
01:48:14,484 --> 01:48:18,921
You would give up your life
for someone like us.

1400
01:48:20,023 --> 01:48:21,388
A vampire.

1401
01:48:22,792 --> 01:48:25,226
A soulless monster.

1402
01:48:25,295 --> 01:48:27,286
Just get away from her!

1403
01:48:31,401 --> 01:48:35,838
You don't know a thing about his soul.



1405
01:48:47,450 --> 01:48:49,145
This is a sadness.

1406
01:48:51,287 --> 01:48:54,848
If only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

1407
01:49:03,766 --> 01:49:05,028
Wait!

1408
01:49:06,669 --> 01:49:08,762
Bella will be one of us.

1409
01:49:10,473 --> 01:49:11,963
I've seen it.

1410
01:49:13,743 --> 01:49:15,677
I'll change her myself.

1411
01:49:49,579 --> 01:49:51,069
Mesmerizing.

1412
01:49:51,514 --> 01:49:55,917
To see what you have seen
before it has happened.

1413
01:49:58,855 --> 01:50:03,315
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1414
01:50:04,561 --> 01:50:05,994
immortal,

1415
01:50:07,063 --> 01:50:08,587
Isabella.

1416
01:50:13,469 --> 01:50:14,902
Go now.

1417
01:50:15,605 --> 01:50:17,573
Make your preparations.

1418
01:50:18,374 --> 01:50:20,365
Let us be done with this.

1419
01:50:22,211 --> 01:50:24,475
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1420
01:50:26,349 --> 01:50:29,750
Thank you for your visit.

1421
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:31,377
CAIUS: We will return the favor.

1422
01:50:31,454 --> 01:50:34,423
I would advise that you follow through
on your promise soon.

1423
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:36,856
We do not offer second chances.

1424
01:50:38,494 --> 01:50:41,588
ARO: Goodbye, my young friends.



1426
01:50:47,971 --> 01:50:49,802
DEMETRl: Nice fishing, Heidi.

1427
01:50:49,872 --> 01:50:52,102
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1428
01:50:52,175 --> 01:50:53,904
Save some for me.

1429
01:50:54,877 --> 01:50:57,675
HEIDl: This way, please. Stay together.







1433
01:51:12,328 --> 01:51:13,852
Stop! Stop!

1434
01:51:24,741 --> 01:51:26,265
You're here.

1435
01:51:28,311 --> 01:51:29,903
You can sleep.

1436
01:51:33,683 --> 01:51:36,311
I'll still be here when you wake up.

1437
01:51:39,922 --> 01:51:42,948
Bella, the only reason I left

1438
01:51:44,727 --> 01:51:47,662
was because I thought
I was protecting you.

1439
01:51:49,532 --> 01:51:51,193
I needed you

1440
01:51:51,267 --> 01:51:55,203
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1441
01:51:59,308 --> 01:52:01,674
It was so easy for you to leave.

1442
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:07,943
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in 100 years.



1444
01:52:14,724 --> 01:52:16,282
And I swear,

1445
01:52:17,627 --> 01:52:20,255
I will never fail you again.

1446
01:52:22,565 --> 01:52:24,123
I'm so sorry.

1447
01:52:26,536 --> 01:52:28,470
- Charlie's coming.
- Hey.

1448
01:52:31,607 --> 01:52:33,006
You okay?

1449
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,672
I'm fine.

1450
01:52:38,781 --> 01:52:40,942
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1451
01:52:41,484 --> 01:52:43,475
You know, last time you said that,
you took off.

1452
01:52:43,553 --> 01:52:45,714
I didn't see you for three days.

1453
01:52:47,423 --> 01:52:49,323
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1454
01:52:51,094 --> 01:52:54,791
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1455
01:52:57,633 --> 01:52:58,725
Ever.

1456
01:53:01,537 --> 01:53:03,095
And you're grounded

1457
01:53:03,573 --> 01:53:05,700
for the rest of your life.

1458
01:53:06,876 --> 01:53:08,036
Okay.

1459
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:21,119
I'm not technically
breaking any of his rules.

1460
01:53:24,127 --> 01:53:27,358
He did say
I couldn't take a step inside the door.

1461
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:30,128
I came in through the window.

1462
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:36,261
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1463
01:53:38,741 --> 01:53:40,038
I know.

1464
01:53:42,078 --> 01:53:43,443
Can you?

1465
01:53:47,216 --> 01:53:48,774
I hope you can,

1466
01:53:49,585 --> 01:53:52,782
'cause I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1467
01:53:57,126 --> 01:53:58,525
Come here.

1468
01:54:16,179 --> 01:54:19,148
Once Alice changes me,

1469
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:24,211
you can't get rid of me.

1470
01:54:25,454 --> 01:54:27,752
She won't need to change you.

1471
01:54:28,357 --> 01:54:31,849
There are always ways
to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1472
01:54:33,563 --> 01:54:35,963
No. No.

1473
01:54:42,738 --> 01:54:44,729
You all know what I want.

1474
01:54:46,943 --> 01:54:49,912
And I know how much I'm asking for.

1475
01:54:52,181 --> 01:54:55,673
The only thing that I can think of
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1476
01:54:55,751 --> 01:54:59,118
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.

1477
01:55:00,723 --> 01:55:01,917
Alice?

1478
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:04,951
I already consider you my sister.

1479
01:55:08,731 --> 01:55:10,358
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1480
01:55:10,433 --> 01:55:11,923
JASPER: I vote "yes."

1481
01:55:13,369 --> 01:55:16,861
It would be nice to not
want to kill you all the time.

1482
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:19,730
Hmm.

1483
01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:21,207
ROSALIE: I'm sorry.

1484
01:55:23,112 --> 01:55:26,240
I'm really sorry to both of you
for how I've acted,

1485
01:55:26,883 --> 01:55:28,942
and I'm really grateful
that you were brave enough

1486
01:55:29,018 --> 01:55:31,111
to go and save my brother.

1487
01:55:32,655 --> 01:55:36,091
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

1488
01:55:38,628 --> 01:55:42,291
And I wish that there'd been someone
to vote "no" for me.

1489
01:55:45,201 --> 01:55:46,600
So, no.

1490
01:55:48,037 --> 01:55:49,937
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1491
01:55:51,874 --> 01:55:54,240
And we can pick a fight
with these Volturi some other way.

1492
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:57,279
I already consider you
a part of the family.

1493
01:55:57,914 --> 01:55:59,142
Yes.

1494
01:55:59,482 --> 01:56:00,471
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)

1495
01:56:05,021 --> 01:56:07,251
Why are you doing this to me?

1496
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:10,323
You know what this means.

1497
01:56:10,393 --> 01:56:14,261
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice.

1498
01:56:14,997 --> 01:56:16,897
I won't lose my son.

1499
01:56:23,105 --> 01:56:27,132
BELLA: I'll wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

1500
01:56:32,148 --> 01:56:35,083
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.



1502
01:56:42,058 --> 01:56:44,151
He wants to talk to me.

1503
01:56:47,296 --> 01:56:48,923
JACOB: So you're still alive for now.

1504
01:56:48,998 --> 01:56:51,466
EDWARD: He thinks it's me keeping
you away.

1505
01:56:51,534 --> 01:56:54,025
JACOB: You stay the hell out of my head.

1506
01:56:55,137 --> 01:56:58,629
Jacob, I know you have something
to say to me.

1507
01:57:00,977 --> 01:57:04,879
But I want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

1508
01:57:06,015 --> 01:57:07,414
Thank you.

1509
01:57:10,553 --> 01:57:13,954
Thank you for keeping Bella alive
when I didn't.

1510
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:16,583
No. You didn't.

1511
01:57:18,594 --> 01:57:21,256
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1512
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:23,195
I'm still grateful.

1513
01:57:23,766 --> 01:57:24,994
But I'm here now.

1514
01:57:25,067 --> 01:57:27,797
I'm not gonna leave her side
until she orders me away.

1515
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:29,201
We'll see.

1516
01:57:32,074 --> 01:57:34,235
Hey, my turn to talk.

1517
01:57:38,814 --> 01:57:42,341
I'm here to remind you
about a key point in the treaty.

1518
01:57:42,518 --> 01:57:44,383
I haven't forgotten.

1519
01:57:44,453 --> 01:57:46,011
What key point?

1520
01:57:46,255 --> 01:57:48,553
If any of them bites a human,

1521
01:57:49,325 --> 01:57:51,088
the truce is over.

1522
01:57:52,495 --> 01:57:54,326
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1523
01:57:54,397 --> 01:57:56,422
No. No, I won't let you.

1524
01:57:58,034 --> 01:58:00,468
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1525
01:58:00,536 --> 01:58:02,436
It's not up to you.

1526
01:58:03,139 --> 01:58:05,505
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1527
01:58:05,574 --> 01:58:07,269
Bella, please, come.

1528
01:58:07,343 --> 01:58:08,503
Wait.

1529
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:13,073
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1530
01:58:20,423 --> 01:58:21,754
Jake,

1531
01:58:28,197 --> 01:58:29,789
I love you.



1533
01:58:34,503 --> 01:58:36,164
So, please,

1534
01:58:40,743 --> 01:58:42,802
don't make me choose,

1535
01:58:48,584 --> 01:58:50,518
'cause it'll be him.

1536
01:58:53,889 --> 01:58:55,754
It's always been him.

1537
01:59:03,232 --> 01:59:04,563
Bella...

1538
01:59:12,341 --> 01:59:15,469
- Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!





1541
01:59:20,249 --> 01:59:22,240
Bella, get out of here.

1542
01:59:24,019 --> 01:59:25,384
BELLA: Stop!

1543
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:28,887
Stop!

1544
01:59:28,958 --> 01:59:32,018
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1545
01:59:51,046 --> 01:59:52,172
Jake.

1546
02:00:07,229 --> 02:00:08,662
He's right.

1547
02:00:09,798 --> 02:00:12,232
You shouldn't become what I am.

1548
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:19,100
I can't do this alone.

1549
02:00:21,777 --> 02:00:23,745
Then, please, just wait.

1550
02:00:30,753 --> 02:00:33,381
Just give me five years.

1551
02:00:38,994 --> 02:00:40,621
That's too long.



1553
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,567
Then three?

1554
02:00:51,273 --> 02:00:53,070
You're so stubborn.

1555
02:00:54,944 --> 02:00:57,037
What are you waiting for?

1556
02:01:05,788 --> 02:01:08,848
I have one condition

1557
02:01:11,327 --> 02:01:13,795
if you want me to do it myself.

1558
02:01:17,933 --> 02:01:19,764
What's the condition?

1559
02:01:20,369 --> 02:01:22,064
And then forever.

1560
02:01:23,839 --> 02:01:25,739
That's what I'm asking.

1561
02:01:37,086 --> 02:01:38,747
Marry me, Bella.





1564
02:04:13,308 --> 02:04:17,176
White demon love song down the hall

1565
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:23,215
White demon shadow on the road

1566
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:28,516
Back up your mind, there is a call

1567
02:04:29,925 --> 02:04:33,656
He isn't coming after all

1568
02:04:33,729 --> 02:04:35,924
Love this time

1569
02:04:35,998 --> 02:04:40,162
She likes the way he sings

1570
02:04:41,003 --> 02:04:44,962
White demon love song's in her dreams

1571
02:04:49,211 --> 02:04:53,443
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1572
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:59,119
White demon sorrow will arrange

1573
02:05:00,289 --> 02:05:04,453
Let's not forget about the fear

1574
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:11,165
Black invitation to this place
that cannot change

1575
02:05:11,233 --> 02:05:16,466
While strangely holy

1576
02:05:16,705 --> 02:05:19,902
Come for a rain

1577
02:05:25,414 --> 02:05:30,477
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1578
02:05:30,953 --> 02:05:36,391
White demon, who let your friend go?

1579
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:41,327
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1580
02:05:41,964 --> 02:05:48,733
White demon, who let your friend go?

1581
02:05:51,607 --> 02:05:57,068
- Let us be in love
- Let us be in love

1582
02:05:57,145 --> 02:06:02,549
- Let's do old and gray
- Let's do old and gray

1583
02:06:02,618 --> 02:06:08,079
- I won't make you cry
- I won't make you cry

1584
02:06:08,156 --> 02:06:13,594
- I will never stray
- I will never stray

1585
02:06:13,662 --> 02:06:19,123
- I will do my part
- I will do my part

1586
02:06:19,201 --> 02:06:24,730
Let us be in love tonight

1587
02:06:24,806 --> 02:06:30,108
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1588
02:06:30,178 --> 02:06:35,309
White demon, who let your friend go?

1589
02:06:35,751 --> 02:06:40,814
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1590
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:47,923
White demon, who let your friend go?

1591
02:07:03,979 --> 02:07:08,211
Stand it anymore, darling

1592
02:07:09,351 --> 02:07:10,716
Stand it



1594
02:07:19,728 --> 02:07:23,630
Meet me on the equinox

1595
02:07:23,699 --> 02:07:26,497
Meet me halfway

1596
02:07:26,568 --> 02:07:29,867
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1597
02:07:29,938 --> 02:07:33,704
In the middle of the day

1598
02:07:33,775 --> 02:07:37,176
Let me give my love to you

1599
02:07:37,713 --> 02:07:40,443
Let me take your hand

1600
02:07:40,882 --> 02:07:44,340
As we walk in the dimming light

1601
02:07:44,419 --> 02:07:47,547
Oh, darling, understand

1602
02:07:47,990 --> 02:07:52,950
That everything, everything ends

1603
02:07:55,030 --> 02:08:00,627
That everything, everything ends

1604
02:08:05,941 --> 02:08:09,638
Meet me on your best behavior

1605
02:08:09,711 --> 02:08:12,612
Meet me at your worst

1606
02:08:12,681 --> 02:08:16,242
For there will be no stone unturned

1607
02:08:16,318 --> 02:08:19,287
Or bubble left to burst

1608
02:08:19,955 --> 02:08:23,516
Let me lay beside you, darling

1609
02:08:24,026 --> 02:08:27,018
Let me be your man

1610
02:08:27,095 --> 02:08:30,531
And let our bodies intertwine

1611
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:34,126
But always understand

1612
02:08:34,202 --> 02:08:39,469
That everything, everything ends

1613
02:08:41,209 --> 02:08:46,943
That everything, everything ends

1614
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:54,985
That everything, everything, everything ends

1615
02:08:58,894 --> 02:09:01,488
A window

1616
02:09:02,431 --> 02:09:06,162
An opened tomb

1617
02:09:06,234 --> 02:09:08,998
The sun crawls

1618
02:09:09,071 --> 02:09:12,700
Across your bedroom

1619
02:09:13,141 --> 02:09:15,336
A halo

1620
02:09:16,678 --> 02:09:20,205
A waiting room

1621
02:09:20,282 --> 02:09:23,217
Your last breaths

1622
02:09:23,285 --> 02:09:25,879
Moving through you

1623
02:09:25,954 --> 02:09:31,221
As everything, everything ends

1624
02:09:32,794 --> 02:09:38,391
As everything, everything, everything

1625
02:09:38,467 --> 02:09:44,895
Everything, everything, everything ends

1626
02:09:50,746 --> 02:09:54,546
Meet me on the equinox

1627
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:57,510
Meet me halfway

1628
02:09:57,586 --> 02:10:01,044
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1629
02:10:01,123 --> 02:10:04,388
In the middle of the day

1630
02:10:04,926 --> 02:10:08,862
Let me give my love to you

1631
02:10:08,930 --> 02:10:11,455
Let me take your hand

1632
02:10:12,033 --> 02:10:15,332
And as we walk in the dimming light

1633
02:10:15,403 --> 02:10:18,566
Oh, darling, understand

1634
02:10:18,707 --> 02:10:25,237
That everything, everything ends
