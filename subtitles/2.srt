- I won't make you cry</i>

1584
02:06:08,156 --> 02:06:13,594
<i>- I will never stray
- I will never stray</i>

1585
02:06:13,662 --> 02:06:19,123
<i>- I will do my part
- I will do my part</i>

1586
02:06:19,201 --> 02:06:24,730
<i>Let us be in love tonight</i>

1587
02:06:24,806 --> 02:06:30,108
<i>White demon, widen your heart's scope</i>

1588
02:06:30,178 --> 02:06:35,309
<i>White demon, who let your friend go?</i>

1589
02:06:35,751 --> 02:06:40,814
<i>White demon, widen your heart's scope</i>

1590
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:47,923
<i>White demon, who let your friend go?</i>

1591
02:07:03,979 --> 02:07:08,211
<i>Stand it anymore, darling</i>

1592
02:07:09,351 --> 02:07:10,716
<i>Stand it</i>

1593
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,556
<i>(MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX</i> PLAYING)

1594
02:07:19,728 --> 02:07:23,630
<i>Meet me on the equinox</i>

1595
02:07:23,699 --> 02:07:26,497
<i>Meet me halfway</i>

1596
02:07:26,568 --> 02:07:29,867
<i>When the sun is perched at its highest peak</i>

1597
02:07:29,938 --> 02:07:33,704
<i>In the middle of the day</i>

1598
02:07:33,775 --> 02:07:37,176
<i>Let me give my love to you</i>

1599
02:07:37,713 --> 02:07:40,443
<i>Let me take your hand</i>

1600
02:07:40,882 --> 02:07:44,340
<i>As we walk in the dimming light</i>

1601
02:07:44,419 --> 02:07:47,547
<i>Oh, darling, understand</i>

1602
02:07:47,990 --> 02:07:52,950
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

1603
02:07:55,030 --> 02:08:00,627
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

1604
02:08:05,941 --> 02:08:09,638
<i>Meet me on your best behavior</i>

1605
02:08:09,711 --> 02:08:12,612
<i>Meet me at your worst</i>

1606
02:08:12,681 --> 02:08:16,242
<i>For there will be no stone unturned</i>

1607
02:08:16,318 --> 02:08:19,287
<i>Or bubble left to burst</i>

1608
02:08:19,955 --> 02:08:23,516
<i>Let me lay beside you, darling</i>

1609
02:08:24,026 --> 02:08:27,018
<i>Let me be your man</i>

1610
02:08:27,095 --> 02:08:30,531
<i>And let our bodies intertwine</i>

1611
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:34,126
<i>But always understand</i>

1612
02:08:34,202 --> 02:08:39,469
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

1613
02:08:41,209 --> 02:08:46,943
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

1614
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:54,985
<i>That everything, everything, everything ends</i>

1615
02:08:58,894 --> 02:09:01,488
<i>A window</i>

1616
02:09:02,431 --> 02:09:06,162
<i>An opened tomb</i>

1617
02:09:06,234 --> 02:09:08,998
<i>The sun crawls</i>

1618
02:09:09,071 --> 02:09:12,700
<i>Across your bedroom</i>

1619
02:09:13,141 --> 02:09:15,336
<i>A halo</i>

1620
02:09:16,678 --> 02:09:20,205
<i>A waiting room</i>

1621
02:09:20,282 --> 02:09:23,217
<i>Your last breaths</i>

1622
02:09:23,285 --> 02:09:25,879
<i>Moving through you</i>

1623
02:09:25,954 --> 02:09:31,221
<i>As everything, everything ends</i>

1624
02:09:32,794 --> 02:09:38,391
<i>As everything, everything, everything</i>

1625
02:09:38,467 --> 02:09:44,895
<i>Everything, everything, everything ends</i>

1626
02:09:50,746 --> 02:09:54,546
<i>Meet me on the equinox</i>

1627
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:57,510
<i>Meet me halfway</i>

1628
02:09:57,586 --> 02:10:01,044
<i>When the sun is perched at its highest peak</i>

1629
02:10:01,123 --> 02:10:04,388
<i>In the middle of the day</i>

1630
02:10:04,926 --> 02:10:08,862
<i>Let me give my love to you</i>

1631
02:10:08,930 --> 02:10:11,455
<i>Let me take your hand</i>

1632
02:10:12,033 --> 02:10:15,332
<i>And as we walk in the dimming light</i>

1633
02:10:15,403 --> 02:10:18,566
<i>Oh, darling, understand</i>

1634
02:10:18,707 --> 02:10:25,237
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>
