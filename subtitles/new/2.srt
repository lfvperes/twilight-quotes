(GASPS SOFTLY)

Edward, don't! She'll see you.

10
Hmm.

11
Okay.

12
(IN BELLA'S VOICE)
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

13
(GASPS)

14
Happy birthday, Bella.

15
(GASPS)

16
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17
Happy birthday.

18
(BELLA CLICKS TONGUE)

19
I thought we agreed, no presents.

20
Well, the one from me's not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

21
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

22
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

23
Well, she coordinated me.

24
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

25
(SIGHS) Senior year.

26
- How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't. It's not that old.

27
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

28
No. No way.

29
(SIGHS)

30
Happy birthday.

31
That's really funny.

39
- Hi.
- MIKE: I'm...

40
JESSICA: Today's the big day, Bella.

41
R and J essay due.

42
- Oh, yeah.
- Wherefore art thou, Bella?

43
(ALL LAUGH)

44
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,
a scrapbook full of memories.

46
ERIC: Oh.
MIKE: Cool. Yeah.

47
I take them. I'm not in them.

48
- No, no, no, come here.
- BELLA: Well, you are today.

49
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?

50
ERIC: Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

51
BELLA: That's good.

52
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

53
(ERIC CHEERS WEAKLY)

54
Well, talk to you later.

55
- Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

56
EDWARD: Mmm.

57
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.

58
- Yeah, but my aging's not.
- Your aging?

59
(CHUCKLES)

60
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.

61
It's one year older than you.

62
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

63
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.

64
- Mmm.
- It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

65
Uh-huh.

66
(BOTH SIGHING)

67
- We have to go to class.
- Okay.

68
(EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY)

69
Wait a second.

70
Someone wants you.

71
- JACOB: Bella!
- Jacob!

72
What?

73
I'll leave you to talk.

74
Hello, biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

75
(JACOB LAUGHS)

76
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

77
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.

78
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

79
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

80
They let any old riffraff into this place.

81
- I see. Then why are you slumming it?
- Mmm-hmm.

82
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

83
You should really come take a ride when it's done.

84
Is it fast?

85
Um.

86
It's decent.

87
(BOTH LAUGH)

88
- I'm kidding.
- Okay. Good.

89
Hey, happy birthday.

90
Your dad told my dad, so...

91
Yeah, of course he did.

92
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

93
Catches bad dreams.

94
That's kind of perfect.

95
Thank you.

96
No problem.

97
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

98
Bye.

99
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?

100
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

101
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.

102
(EXHALES)

103
See? Thank you.

104
- That's all I want.
- ALICE: Bella!

105
- Happy birthday!
- Shh, shh!

106
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

107
I thought I said no presents.

108
I've already seen you open it,
and guess what,
you love it.

110
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

111
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

112
- Okay. All right.
- Great!

113
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

114
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

115
(ALICE LAUGHS)

116
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

117
Never mind.

You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love! My wife!

120
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

122
Thou art not conquered.

123
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

124
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

125
BELLA: I hate being celebrated.

126
EDWARD: There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.

127
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

128
BELLA: Yeah.

129
Though I do envy him one thing.

130
BELLA: Juliet is, like, perfect.

131
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

132
(EDWARD LAUGHS)

133
Not the girl, the suicide.

134
It's nearly impossible for...

135
For some people.

136
For humans, a little poison,
a dagger to the heart.

138
There's so many different options.

139
Why would you say that?

140
Because I had to consider it once.

141
(BELLA SCREAMING)

142
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

143
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

144
What was the plan?

145
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

146
- The what?
- The Volturi.

147
MR. BERTY: Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?

149
Mr. Cullen?

150
(INHALES DEEPLY)

151
Yes, Mr. Berty.

152
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

153
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.

154
"Eyes, look your last.

156
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"

158
Eyes on the screen, people.

159
ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die.

160
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

161
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.

162
- Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.

163
He lived with them for a few decades.

164
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,
but a respect for the arts and the sciences,
at least.

166
And the law.

167
Above all, the law.

168
BELLA: Vampires have laws?

169
EDWARD: Not very many.

170
And only one that's regularly enforced.

171
BELLA: What is it?

172
EDWARD: That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.

173
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
and we don't kill conspicuously.

175
Unless, of course, you want to die.

176
(SCREAMS)

177
You gotta stop talking about that.

178
I can't even think about someone hurting you.

179
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.

180
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.

181
That's not true.

182
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

183
Alice will see when she decides,
and we'll be ready.

184
I could protect you if you change me.

186
Bella, you already do protect me.

187
You're my only reason to stay alive,
if that's what I am.

190
But it's my job to protect you.

191
(BELLA SIGHS)

192

199
- We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.

200
- Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.

201
I found it in your bag. You mind?

202
Dating an older woman. Hot.

203
(SIGHS EXASPERATEDLY)

204
- What?
- You first, Rosalie.

205
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

206
Thanks.

207
Show me the love.

208
This one's from Emmett.

209
Already installed it in your truck.

210
Finally a decent sound system

- for that piece of...
- Hey! Don't hate the truck.

DR. CULLEN: Get Jasper out of here.

225
(BELLA GASPS)

226
I'm sorry, I can't.

227
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

228
Check on Jasper.

229
I'm sure he's very upset with himself,
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.

231
Edward.

232
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)

233
BELLA: I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN: It's not your fault.

234
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.

235
How do you do it?

236
Years and years of practice.

237
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?

238
No.

239
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

240
It brings me happiness,
even if I am damned regardless.

241
Damned?

242
Like hell?

243
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

244
You couldn't. It's impossible.

245
Thank you, Bella.

246
You've always been very gracious about us.

247
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

248
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

249
If you believed as Edward does,
could you take away his soul?

251
You can't protect me from everything.

253
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

254
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.

257
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

258
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.

259
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?

260
Carlisle told me how you feel about your soul.

262
I don't believe that.

263
So don't worry about mine.

264
You should go inside.

265
It's still my birthday.

266
So can I ask one thing?

267
Kiss me?

268
(BELLA GASPS)

I love you.

Hey.

Just come take a walk with me.

We have to leave Forks.

283
Why?

284
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks,
and people are starting to notice.

286
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.

287
When you say "we"...

288
I mean my family and myself.

289
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

290
You're right. It was nothing,
nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.

293
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

294
I belong with you.

295
No. You don't.

296
I'm coming.

297
Bella,

298
I don't want you to come.

299
(SIGHS)

300
You don't want me?

301
No.

302
That changes things a lot.

303
But if it's not too much to ask,
can you just promise me something?

305
Don't do anything reckless.

306
For Charlie's sake.

307
And I'll promise something to you in return.

308
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

309
I won't come back,
and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.

311
It will be like I never existed, I promise.

312
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.

313
It's not about your soul.

314
You're just not good for me.

315
Not good enough for you.

316
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.

like everything else.

346
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

347
When you left,
and he left,
you took everything with you.

But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

(BELLA SCREAMING)

The pain is my only reminder that he was real,
that you all were.

359
All right. That's it.

360
What?

361
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.

362
I'm not leaving Forks.

363
Bells, he's not coming back.

364
I know.

365
It's just not normal, this behavior.

366
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.

367
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

368
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

369
I like my old friends.

- Well, you never see them anymore.
- I do.

371
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.

- You hate shopping.
- I...

I need a girls' night out.

379
Yeah, Bella Swan.

JESSICA: I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.

382
It's gross. Like... And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?

383
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,
my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?

385
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?

386
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like,
self-referential cleverness, you know?

388
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

389
Although I was surprised you even called at all. You know?

390
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.

391
But after a while it's like,

392
- you're still bumming...
- CHET: You want a ride, girls?

393
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.

God, that was such a rush.

That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

439
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

then that's what I'll find.

I saved it from the junkyard.

I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth,
but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend

453
- to help me out then...
- Ah!

454
- Me being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

455
- Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.

456
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.

457
Yeah, I mean,
it's completely stupid and reckless.

458
When do we start?

459
Um.

460
Now.

461
- Please?
- (CHUCKLES) All right.

462
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...

463
Jake, you're, like, buff.

464
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

It feels like that sometimes.

if we're gonna do this every day,
and hopefully we will,
we have to, like,
fit some homework in there somewhere.

475
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

476
You? Influence me? Please.

477
Are you... I'm older than you,
so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.

479
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.

480
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.

482
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.

483
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?

Okay. So where do we stand?

493
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?

494
Uh...

495
We're friends, you know.

496
- (LAUGHS) Burn.
- Actually,
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

498
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?

499
Nope.

500
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

501
(JACOB LAUGHING)

502
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

503
Yeah, that's still a riot.

504
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

505
(JACOB AND QUIL LAUGHING)

506
Jeez.

507
JACOB: Hey, that hold's illegal!

508
EMBRY: I got five bucks on Quil.

509
You're on.

510
(SHOO TING THE MOON PLAYING)

511
All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups

512
Waiting for the big hero to show

513
Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands

514
And his heart in his throat

515
What can he tell them now

516
BELLA: Dear Alice,

517
I wish I had your real address.

518
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

519
He makes me feel better.

520
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

521
The hole in my chest,
well, when I'm with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed for a while.

524
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

525
Oh.

526
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing. You know?

527
(CHUCKLES)

528
What's up with you and age?

529
I mean,
how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

530
BELLA: But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.

531
(BELLA WHIMPERING)

532
(SCREAMING)

533
Hey, hey, hey!

534
Wake up, Bella.

535
(SHUSHING) You're okay. You're okay.

536
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.

537
(CHARLIE SIGHS)

538
Can I ask you something?

539
Hanging out with Jacob,
that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?

541
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

543
You know what I mean?

544
Of course, what do I know?

545
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

546
Famous ladies' man.

547
Okay.

548
I'm gonna go to bed.

549
Uh...

550
I love you.

551
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?

552
Are you doubting your mad skills?

553
No. Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.

554
It's just,
maybe if I was smart,
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

556
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,
but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.

558
(LAUGHS)

559
Is that Sam Uley?

560
Yeah. Him and his cult.

561
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

562
(WHOOPS)

563
Oh, my God.

564
Did you see that?

565
(JACOB LAUGHING)

566
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

567
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

568
- A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

569
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.

570
You have some kind of beef with him or something?

571
I don't know.

572
They just think they run this place.

573
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.

574
- Now look at him.
- That's Embry?

575
(CONTINUE WHOOPING)

576
- Yeah.
- What happened to him?

577
He missed some school.

578
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.

579
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

580
Sam keeps giving me this look,
like he's waiting for me or something.

582
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

583
Well, you should just avoid him.

584
I try.

585
Okay.

586
- You look scared.
- I'm not.

587
All right.

588
- Brake?
- That one.

589
Clutch?

590
Good.

591
Gas?

592
(ENGINE ROARS)

593
Ready?

594
Now, slowly release the clutch.

595
EDWARD: Bella.

596
Stop.

597
(BELLA GASPS)

598
Whoa!

599
You all right?

600
I'm gonna go again.

601
Okay.

602
(GASPS)

603
Ah!

604
Whoa!

605
Hit the brake!

606
(GRUNTS)

607
I wanna go again.

608
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

609
- No. I want to go again.
- No. Forget it.

610
No more bikes.

611
Man, your head.

612
Ow.

613
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

614
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

615
Yeah. I guess I am.

616
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

617
There.

618
What are you staring at?

619
You're sort of beautiful.

620
How hard did you hit your head?

621
I don't know.

622
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

623
Let's go.

624
ANGELA: I did see something in the woods.

625
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

626
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

627
(ERIC LAUGHS)

628
ANGELA: No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.

629
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

630
A bear, maybe?

631
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

632
(ERIC AND MIKE SNICKERING)

633
ANGELA: Well, I saw it.

634
You know, you're not the only one.

635
My dad's been getting reports at the station.

636
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.

637
But they can't find the bear.

638
Hmm.

639
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

640
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

641
MIKE: Um...

642
(MIKE CLEARS THROAT)

643
So? I mean,

644
Bella's back?

645
(LAUGHS)

646
Yeah, I guess so.

647
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

648
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

650
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

651
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do.

652
Cool.

653
Let me see, we could check out

654
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

655
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

656
- I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
- No. No romance.

657
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?

658
I mean, that's an action movie.

659
Yeah, that's perfect.

660
Guns, adrenaline.

661
That's my thing.

662
Okay.

663
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

664
ERIC: Face Punch, yeah!

665
Mike, hey,
we were supposed to watch that.

666
Remember, the trailer's like...

667
- "Punch faces."
- I remember.

668
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.

669
JACOB: So Face Punch, huh?

670
You like action movies?

671
Not really.

672
(JACOB SCOFFING)

673
I heard it sucks. Bad.

674
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

675
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

676
Right, yeah, well,
she's buying my ticket for me.

677
She's buying it. Okay.

678
Jessica bailed,
and Angela got the stomach flu,
so Eric's taking care of her.

680
- It's just us three.
- Great!

681
- Great.
- Yeah.

682
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)

683
MAN 1 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down.

684
MAN 2 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.

685
MAN 3 ON SCREEN: Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.

687
MAN 1 ON SCREEN: All right, forget it,
let's do this!

688
(GUNS FIRING)

689
(MAN SCREAMS)

690
(GUNS FIRING)

691
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

692
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.

693
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

694
He's...

695
(SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!

696
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.

697
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.

698
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.

699
(JACOB CHUCKLES)

700
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's going around.

701
What? I can't hold your hand?

702
No, of course you can.

703
I just think it means, you know,
something a little different to you. So...

704
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

705
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?

706
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.

707
(BELLA SIGHS)

708
Why?

709
Because you're about to ruin everything.

710
And I need you.

711
(SIGHS)

712
Well, I've got loads of time.

713
I'm not gonna give up.

714
I don't want you to,
but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.

716
And that's really selfish.

717
You know,
I'm not like a car that you can fix up.

718
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

719
It's because of him, right?

720
(JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY)

721
Look,

722
I know what he did to you.

723
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.

724
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

725
I won't let you down.

726
You can count on me.

727
MIKE: Well,

728
(SNIFFLES)

729
(SIGHS)

730
I need to go home.

731
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

732
(JACOB SCOFFS)

733
What is your problem?

734
Right now? You're my problem.

735
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

736
You want me to put you in the hospital?

737
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

738
You're really hot.

739
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

740
I don't know what's happening.

741
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

742
I gotta go.

743
That dude is weird.

744
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake,
your dad says you have mono.

745
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

746
Hey, it's me again. I just...

747
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.

748
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

749
Jacob, please...

750
Call me.

751
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

752
(SIGHS)

753
Hey.

754
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.

755
Yes, you do.

756
Yeah, you do.
Go. What are you talking about?

757
Just be careful.

758
Always am.

759
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

760
My kung fu is strong.

761
Jake!

762
Hey!

763
You cut your hair off?

764
And got a tattoo?

765
Bella.

766
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.

768
Go away.

769
What?

770
Go away.

771
What happened to you? What's...

772
Hey! What happened?

773
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

774
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

775
But if you want somebody to blame,
how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?

777
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

778
I don't know what you're talking about.

779
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

780
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

781
But you can't lie to me.

782
- Not anymore, Bella.
- SAM: Jacob!

783
Jacob!

784
Look, Bella,
we can't be friends anymore.

786
(CRYING) Look, Jake,
I know that I've been hurting you.

787
It's killing me. It kills me.

788
I just need... Maybe give me, like,

789
- some time or something.
- Look, don't.

790
It's not you.

791
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

792
It's true. It is me.

793
I'm not good.

794
I used to be a good kid.

795
Not anymore.

796
This doesn't even matter. All right?

797
This is over.

798
You can't break up with me.

799
I mean...

800
I mean, you're my best friend.

801
You promised me.

802
I know.

803
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

804
And this is me keeping that promise.

805
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.

807
BELLA: Alice,
things are...

809
Things are bad again.

810
Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.

811
I don't see Edward anymore.

812
Will it really feel like he never existed?

813
I will find the place where I can see him again.

814
(SOBBING)

815
Bella.

816
Laurent.

817
I didn't expect to find you here.

818
I went to visit the Cullens,
but the house is empty.

819
I'm surprised they left you behind.

820
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?

822
Yeah. You could say that.

823
Do the Cullens visit often?

824
Lie.

825
(GASPS)

826
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

827
Lie better.

828
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

829
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,

831
'cause he's pretty protective.

832
But he's far away, isn't he?

833
Why are you here?

834
I came as a favor to Victoria.

835
- Victoria?
- She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.

837
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate,
given he killed hers.

839
An eye for an eye.

840
Threaten him.

841
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

842
I don't think he will.

843
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?

845
(LAURENT SIGHS)

846
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you,
but I can't help myself.

848
You are so mouth-watering.

849
- Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
- No, no, no, no.

850
(SHUSHING)

851
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.

852
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly,
painfully,
whereas I'll make it quick.

855
I promise.

856
You will feel nothing.

857
Edward, I love you.

858
(TWIGS SNAPPING)

859
I don't believe it.

(YELPING)

865
(GASPS)

866
- Dad! I saw them.
- What's the matter?

867
- In the woods. They're not bears.
- What do you mean "in the woods"?

868
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?

869
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.

870
Are you sure about that, Bella?

871
Yeah! I just saw them.
They were after something.

872
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)

873
Wolves?

874
You saw them?

875
All right, well, Harry,
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

877
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

878
BELLA: By now, those wolves will be dead,
and Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.

880
Victoria.

881
I should go to the station.

882
Yeah, you should. You should go.

883
CHARLIE: Can you just stay in the house?

888
You scared me.

889
- What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.

890
(GASPS)

891
Hey.

892
Look, I'm sorry.

893
- For what?
- I wish I could explain.

894
But I literally can't.

895
(SIGHS)

896
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone,
one that wasn't yours to share?

898
Well, that's what it's like for me.

899
But worse.

900
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.

901
I hate this.

902
I hate what they've done to you.

903
I mean, the killer part is,
you already know.

904
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?

905
The...

906
The story. The story about the cold ones.

908
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.

909
There's gotta be something that you can do.

910
No. I'm in it for life.

911
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.

912
Just leave,
just you and me.

914
You'd do that?

915
I would do it for you.

916
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

917
But I would run away with you if I could.

919
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.

920
Come here.

921
(SOFTLY) Please,
try to remember.

923
It'd be so much easier if you knew.

925
I'll try. But, Jake...

926
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

927
(GASPS)

928
Jake.

929
(GASPS)

930
Edward, I'm scared.

931
You should be.

932

933
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

934
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?

935
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)

936

937
I need to see him.

938
He's not in.

- Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!

940
What did you do?

941
- Okay, what did you do?
- Hey.

942
- What did you do to him?
- Easy!

943
He didn't want this.

944
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

945
- Both of you calm down.
- Nothing.

946
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.

947

- Too late now.
- SAM: Bella, get back!

961
The fairy tales and horror stories?

962
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?

963
(BOTH WHOOP)

964
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.

965
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

966
No way. Jacob's a natural.

967
You see him phase on the fly?

Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

Guess so.

Well, I'm engaged to one.

Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

986
Sure. Thanks.

987
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.

988
He didn't say anything to me.

989
That's a wolf thing.

990
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.

991
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

992
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

994
You can't really run with vampires.

997
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

998
Freaked out yet?

You're not the first monsters I've met.

1000
SAM: Jake's right. You're good with weird.

1001
Hey.

1002
(EMILY GIGGLING)

1003
Sorry.

1004
So you're a werewolf?

1005
Yeah. Last time I checked.

1006
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.

1007
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.

1008
Mono.

1009
Yeah. I wish.

1010
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

1011
I mean, it's wrong.

1012
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

1013
I was born this way. I can't help it.

1014
You're such a hypocrite. What,
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

1015
It's not what you are.

1016
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

1017
You've killed people, Jake.

1018
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

1019
Then who is?

1020
What we're trying to protect you people from,
the only thing we do kill,
vampires.

1023
Wait, Jake, you can't.

1024
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.

1026
That's not what I'm saying.

1027
You can't kill vampires. They'II...

1028
They'll kill you.

1029
Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.

And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

1033
Victoria's here?

1034
Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.

1035
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

1036
I do.

1037
Me.

1038
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

1039
She won't get near you or Charlie.

1040
Look, you've got to be careful.

1041
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

1042
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.

1043
All right, I'd better go.

1044
You gotta go?

1045
Yeah.

1046
Got a vampire to kill.

1047
BELLA: Alice, I'm all right.

1048
Until I'm alone.

1049
And lately, that's all the time.

1050
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

1051
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

1052
And you're gone.

1053
And so is Edward.

1054
And there's just nothing now.

1055
You got something, Harry?

1056
Nope. Nothing.

But I realize where I have to go,
what I have to do to see him again.

but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

I wouldn't let that happen.

Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?

I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.

Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?

Um...

That's probably me.

Or it's Jacob.

1182
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.

I thought you couldn't protect me here.

Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.

Victoria?

Yeah, Victoria's been around.

I didn't see her.

I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.

Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?

No.

- Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

Why didn't you let me speak to him?

I would have chosen for myself.

1488
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.

So, no.

(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)

1495
Why are you doing this to me?

1496
You know what this means.

1497
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice.

1498
I won't lose my son.

1499
BELLA: I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.

1500
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1501
(TIRES SCREECH)

1502
He wants to talk to me.

1503
JACOB: So you're still alive for now.

1504
EDWARD: He thinks it's me keeping you away.

1505
JACOB: You stay the hell out of my head.

1506
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.

1507
But I want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

1508
Thank you.

1509
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.

1510
No. You didn't.

1511
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1512
I'm still grateful.

1513
But I'm here now.

1514
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.

1515
We'll see.

1516
Hey, my turn to talk.

1517
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.

1518
I haven't forgotten.

1519
What key point?

1520
If any of them bites a human,
the truce is over.

1522
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1523
No. No, I won't let you.

1524
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1525
It's not up to you.

1526
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1527
Bella, please, come.

1528
Wait.

1529
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1530
Jake,

1531
I love you.

1532
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)

1533
So, please,
don't make me choose,

1535
'cause it'll be him.

1536
It's always been him.

1537
Bella...

1538
- Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!

1539
(GROWLING)

1540
(ROARS)

1541
Bella, get out of here.

1542
BELLA: Stop!

1543
Stop!

1544
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.

1545
Jake.

1546
He's right.

1547
You shouldn't become what I am.

1548
I can't do this alone.

1549
Then, please, just wait.

1550
Just give me five years.

1551
That's too long.

1552
(SIGHS)

1553
Then three?

1554
You're so stubborn.

1555
What are you waiting for?

1556
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.

1558
What's the condition?

1559
And then forever.

1560
That's what I'm asking.

1561
Marry me, Bella.

1562

(A WHITE DEMON LO VE SONG PLAYING)

1564
White demon love song down the hall

1565
White demon shadow on the road

1566
Back up your mind, there is a call

1567
He isn't coming after all

1568
Love this time

1569
She likes the way he sings

1570
White demon love song's in her dreams

1571
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1572
White demon sorrow will arrange

1573
Let's not forget about the fear

1574
Black invitation to this place that cannot change

1575
While strangely holy

1576
Come for a rain

1577
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1578
White demon, who let your friend go?

1579
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1580
White demon, who let your friend go?

1581
- Let us be in love
- Let us be in love

1582
- Let's do old and gray
- Let's do old and gray

1583
- I won't make you cry
- I won't make you cry

1584
- I will never stray
- I will never stray

1585
- I will do my part
- I will do my part

1586
Let us be in love tonight

1587
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1588
White demon, who let your friend go?

1589
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1590
White demon, who let your friend go?

1591
Stand it anymore, darling

1592
Stand it

(MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX PLAYING)

1594
Meet me on the equinox

1595
Meet me halfway

1596
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1597
In the middle of the day

1598
Let me give my love to you

1599
Let me take your hand

1600
As we walk in the dimming light

1601
Oh, darling, understand

1602
That everything, everything ends

1603
That everything, everything ends

1604
Meet me on your best behavior

1605
Meet me at your worst

1606
For there will be no stone unturned

1607
Or bubble left to burst

1608
Let me lay beside you, darling

1609
Let me be your man

1610
And let our bodies intertwine

1611
But always understand

1612
That everything, everything ends

1613
That everything, everything ends

1614
That everything, everything, everything ends

1615
A window

1616
An opened tomb

1617
The sun crawls

1618
Across your bedroom

1619
A halo

1620
A waiting room

1621
Your last breaths

1622
Moving through you

1623
As everything, everything ends

1624
As everything, everything, everything

1625
Everything, everything, everything ends

1626
Meet me on the equinox

1627
Meet me halfway

1628
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1629
In the middle of the day

1630
Let me give my love to you

1631
Let me take your hand

1632
And as we walk in the dimming light

1633
Oh, darling, understand

1634
That everything, everything ends
