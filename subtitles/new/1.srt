1
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.

2
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.

3
So I can't bring myself to regret the decision to leave home.

4
I would miss Phoenix.

5
I'd miss the heat.

6
I would miss my loving,
erratic, harebrained mother.

7
Okay.

8
Renee, come on.

9
And her new husband.

10
Guys, come on.
I love you both.

11
We got a plane to catch.

12
But they want to go on the road,
so I'm gonna spend some time with my dad,
and this will be a good thing.

15
I think.

21
In the state of Washington,
under a near constant cover of clouds and rain,
there's a small town named Forks.

24
Population, 3,120 people.

25
This is where I'm moving.

26
My dad's Charlie.

27
He's the chief of police.

30
Your hair's longer.

31
I cut it since the last time
I saw you.

32
Guess it grew out again.

33
I used to spend two weeks here almost every summer,
but it's been years.

35
I've cleared some shelves off in the bathroom.

36
Right. One bathroom.

37
It's a pretty good work lamp.

38
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.

39
You like purple, right?

40
Purple's cool.

41
Thanks.

42
Okay.

43
One of the best things about Charlie,
he doesn't hover.

45
Heard you guys coming all the way down the road.

46
Good to see you.

47
Bella, you remember
Billy Black.

48
Yeah.

49
Wow, you're looking good.

50
Well, I'm still dancing.

51
I'm glad you're finally here.

52
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.

53
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

54
After I ram you in the ankles.

55
You want to go?

56
Yeah.

57
Bring it.

58
Hi, I'm Jacob.

59
Hey.

60
We used to make mud pies when we were little.

61
Right. No, I remember.

62
Are they always like this?

63
It's getting worse with old age.

64
Good.

65
So, what do you think?

66
Of what?

67
Your homecoming present.

68
This?

69
Just bought it off Billy here.

70
Yep.

71
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.

72
Come on.

73
Oh, my gosh!

74
This is perfect.
Are you joking me?

75
Sorry.

76
I told you she'd love it.

77
I'm down with the kids.

78
Oh, yeah, dude.
You're the bomb.

79
Okay.

80
Listen,
you gotta double-pump the clutch when you shift,
but besides that,
you should be good.

82
That's this one?

83
Yeah. Yeah, right there.

84
All right.

85
Do you want a ride to school or something?

86
I go to school on the reservation.

87
Right, right.

88
Yeah.

89
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.

90
My first day at a new school.

91
It's March,
middle of the semester.

92
Great.

93
Nice ride.

94
Thanks.

95
Good one.

96
You're Isabella Swan,
the new girl.

97
Hi, I'm Eric,
the eyes and ears of this place.

98
Anything you need,
tour guide, lunch date,
shoulder to cry on?

99
I'm really kind of the more suffer-in-silence type.

100
Good headline for your feature.

101
I'm on the paper,
and you're news,
baby, front page.

102
No, I'm not.

103
You...

104
Please don't have any sort of...

105
Chillax. No feature.

106
Okay, thanks.

107
Cool?

108
All right. Okay. Yeah.

109
Get it! Get it! Get it!

110
To you!

111
Whoa!

112
I'm sorry.

113
I told them not to let me play.

114
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

115
You're Isabella, right?

116
Just Bella.

117
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

118
Nice to meet you.

119
Yeah, yeah.

120
She's got a great spike, huh?

121
Yeah, it's...

122
I'm Jessica, by the way.

123
Hey, you're from
Arizona, right?

124
Yeah.

125
Aren't people from Arizona supposed to be, like,
really tan?

126
Yeah.

127
Maybe that's why they kicked me out.

128
You're good.

129
That's so funny.

130
Back in, Jess.

131
Down here.

132
Like a masterpiece,
you know,
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,
and then you guys can...

135
It's my pleasure, Madame.

136
You guys can give each other high fives.

137
Burrito, my friend?

138
Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella?

139
Hey.

140
Your home girl?

141
Yeah.

142
Yeah?

143
That's...

144
My girl.

145
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!

146
Tyler.

147
Yes!

148
Oh, my God.

149
It's like first grade all over again.

150
You're the shiny new toy.

151
Smile.

152
Okay.

153
Sorry.

154
I needed a candid for the feature.

155
The feature's dead,
Angela.

156
Don't bring it up again.

157
It's okay, I just...

158
I got your back, baby.

159
Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.

160
You know,
you can always go for eating disorders.

161
Speedo padding on the swim team.

162
Actually, that's a good one.

163
Kirk. Right? That's exactly what I thought.

164
Yeah.

165
We're talking Olympic-size.

166
There's no way.
He's so skinny.

167
It doesn't make sense.

168
Totally.

169
Yeah.

170
Who are they?

171
The Cullens.

172
They're Dr. and Mrs.
Cullen's foster kids.

173
They moved down here from Alaska, like,
a few years ago.

174
They kind of keep to themselves.

175
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

176
Like, together, together.

177
The blonde girl,
that's Rosalie,
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

179
I'm not even sure that's legal.

180
Jess, they're not actually related.

181
Yeah, but they live together.
It's weird.

182
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's Alice.

183
She's really weird,
and she's with Jasper,
the blond one who looks like he's in pain.

185
Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad/matchmaker.

186
Maybe he'll adopt me.

187
Who's he?

188
That's Edward Cullen.

189
He's totally gorgeous,
obviously,
but apparently nobody here's good enough for him.

191
Like I care, you know?

192
So, yeah.

193
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

194
I wasn't planning on it.

195
Mr. Molina.

196
Hey, Mike.

197
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

198
Hi. Can I have the pass?
Thank you.

199
Welcome to the class. Here.
Here's your stuff, okay?

200
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.

201
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.

202
All right, guys, today we are gonna be observing the behavior of planaria,
aka flatworms.

204
So what we're gonna do...

205
...regenerate.

206
Zombie worms.

207
No cell phones.
Guys, let's get to it.

208
Gentle, gentle,
certain areas.

209
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

210
You won't believe this.

211
Let's try to focus while we check those out, huh, guys?

212
There must be something open.

213
Physics? Biochem?

214
No, every class is full.

215
Just a minute, dear.

216
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology.

217
Fine. Just...
I'll just have to endure it.

218
I just can't get over how grown up you are.

219
And so gorgeous.

220
Hey, Bella.

221
You remember me?

222
I played Santa one year.

223
Yeah, Waylon,
she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.

224
I bet I made an impression,
though, didn't I?

225
You always do.

226
Butt-crack Santa?

227
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.

228
All right, let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.

229
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.

230
Berry cobbler, remember?

231
Your dad still has it.
Every Thursday.

232
Thank you.
That'd be great.

233
Here.

234
Thanks.

235
Hey, baby. So, listen,
if spring training goes well,
we could be moving to Florida.

237
Please insert $1.25
for an additional three minutes.

239
Mom, where's your cell?

240
Okay, don't laugh.

241
I didn't lose my power cord.
It ran away.

242
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.

243
I miss you.

244
Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

245
But tell me more about your school.

246
Now, what are the kids like?

247
Are there any cute guys?

248
Are they being nice to you?

249
Well,
they're all very welcoming.

251
Tell me all about it.

252
It doesn't even matter.

253
Yes, it does, honey.

254
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.

255
Okay. I love you.

256
Love you, too.

257
I planned to confront him and demand to know what his problem was.

259
But he never showed.

260
Bella!

261
And the next day,
another no-show.

262
More days passed.

263
Things were getting a little strange.

264
You all right?

265
Yeah, I'm good.

266
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

267
Yeah. That's why
I had some new tires put on the truck.

268
Old ones were getting pretty bald.

269
Well, probably be late for dinner.

270
I gotta head down to Mason County.

271
Security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal.

273
An animal?

274
You're not in
Phoenix anymore, Bells.

275
Anyway,
I figured I'd lend a hand.

276
Be careful.

277
Always am.

278
And thanks for the tires.

279
Yeah.

280
Prom Committee is a chick thing,
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway,
and they need a guy to help choose the music,
so I need your play list.

284
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

285
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

286
How you liking the rain, girl?

287
Better get used to it, girl.

288
Yeah, Mike, hey,
you're real cute, man.

289
Oh, I know...

290
That was really awesome.

291
Why you shooting down my game? Let a playa play.

292
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at,
T-Ball?

293
Hello.

294
I'm sorry,
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself last week.

295
I'm Edward Cullen.

296
You're Bella?

297
Yes.

298
Onion root tip cells,
that's what's on your slides right now.

300
Okay?
So, separate and label them into the phases of mitosis,
and the first partners that get it right are gonna win the Golden Onion.

303
All right, good.

304
Ladies first.

305
You were gone.

306
Yeah.

307
I was out of town for a couple of days.

308
Personal reasons.

309
Prophase.

310
Do you mind if I look?

311
It's prophase.

312
Like I said.

313
So are you enjoying the rain?

314
What?

315
You're asking me about the weather?

316
Yeah, I...

317
I guess I am.

318
Well, I don't really like the rain.

319
Any cold, wet thing,
I don't really...

320
What?

321
Nothing.

322
It's anaphase.

323
You mind if I check?

324
Sure.

325
Anaphase.

326
Like I said.

327
If you hate the cold and the rain so much,
why'd you move to the wettest place in the continental US?

329
It's complicated.

330
I'm sure I can keep up.

331
My mom remarried, and...

332
So you don't like the guy, or...

333
No, that's not...

334
Phil's really nice.

335
It's metaphase.
You want to check it?

336
I believe you.

337
Why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?

338
Well,
Phil's a minor league baseball player,
and he travels a lot,
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,
so I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while.

343
And now you're unhappy.

344
No.

345
I'm sorry, I'm just...

346
I'm just trying to figure you out.

347
You're very difficult for me to read.

348
Hey, did you get contacts?

349
No.

350
Your eyes were black the last time I saw you,
and now they're,
like, golden brown.

352
Yeah, I know, it's the...

353
It's the fluorescents.

354
Bella!

355
Bella!

356
Dial 911!

357
I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.

358
Bella, I'm so sorry.
I panicked.

359
Bella, I've got 911
on the phone now.

360
Bella. You okay?

361
You and I are gonna talk.
You all right?

362
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

363
I'm sorry, Bella.
I tried to stop.

364
I know. It's okay.

365
No.
It sure as hell is not okay.

366
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

367
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

368
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

369
You can kiss your license goodbye.

370
I heard the chief's daughter was here.

371
Dr. Cullen.

372
Charlie.

373
I've got this one,
Jackie.

374
Isabella.

375
Bella.

376
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

377
Good.

378
Look here.

379
You might experience some post-traumatic stress or disorientation,
but your vitals look good.

381
No signs of any head trauma.

382
I think you'll be just fine.

383
I'm so sorry, Bella.
I'm really...

384
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

386
Edward? Your boy?

387
Yeah, it was amazing.

388
I mean,
he got to me so fast.

389
He was nowhere near me.

390
Sounds like you were very lucky.

391
Charlie.

392
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

393
You should probably call your mom.

394
Did you tell her?

395
She's probably just freaking out.

397
...fifteen kids that saw what happened.

398
What was I
supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

399
This isn't just about you.
It's about all of us.

400
I think we should take this in my office.

401
Can I talk to you for a minute?

402
Rosalie.

403
What?

404
How did you get over to me so fast?

405
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

406
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

407
No, I wasn't.

408
Yes, you were.

409
Bella, you're...
You hit your head.

410
I think you're confused.

411
I know what I saw.

412
And what exactly was that?

413
You...

414
You stopped the van.

415
You pushed it away with your hand.

416
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

417
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

418
I just need to know the truth.

419
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

420
Thank you.

421
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

422
No.

423
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

424
And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.

425
I need everybody's permission slips, okay?

426
Sammy, please collect them.

427
Yeah.

428
Guys, let's go.

429
Come on, get in.
In. Let's go!

430
Look at you, huh?
You're alive.

431
I know, yeah.
False alarm, I guess.

432
Yeah.

433
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,
it's like a month away, but...

435
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

436
So, what do you think?

437
About what?

438
Do you want to go?

439
To prom?

440
With me?

441
Prom.

442
Dancing.

443
Not such a good idea for me.

444
I have something that weekend anyway.

445
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

446
You can't go another weekend?

447
Non-refundable ticket.

448
You should ask Jessica.

449
I know she wants to go with you.

450
All right. All right.

451
Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, guys, come on.

452
We gotta go. We gotta go.

453
Green is what? Good.

454
Let's go. Guys, come on.

455
Other bus, other bus.
Let's go.

456
Egg shells, carrot tops.

457
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

458
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

459
Very good, very good.

460
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup of compost tea.

461
Okay.

462
Give me that.

463
Yeah. This is recycling in its most basic form, guys.

464
Don't drink it!
It's for the plants.

465
What's in Jacksonville?

466
How did you know about that?

467
You didn't answer my question.

468
You don't answer any of mine, so...

469
I mean,
you don't even say hi to me.

470
Hi.

471
Are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van?

472
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

473
It's very common.
You can Google it.

474
Floridians.

475
That's what's in Jacksonville.

476
Can you at least watch where you walk?

477
Look, I'm sorry
I'm being rude all the time.

478
I just think it's the best way.

479
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.

480
Who?

481
Yeah,
I actually totally thought that Mike was gonna ask you.

482
It's not gonna be weird,
though, right?

483
No. Zero weirdness.

484
You guys are great together.

485
I know, right?

486
Tyler...

487
Gross.

488
Bella, look. It's a worm.

489
It's a worm.

490
Bella,
we shouldn't be friends.

491
You really should've figured that out a little earlier.

492
I mean,
why didn't you just let the van crush me and save yourself all this regret?

494
What, you think
I regret saving you?

495
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

496
You don't know anything.

497
Hi.

498
Are you gonna be riding with us?

499
No, our bus is full.

500
Your mom called. Again.

501
Well, that's your fault.

502
You shouldn't have told her about the "almost" accident.
You finished?

503
Yeah.

504
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

505
She always did know how to worry.

506
She seems different.

507
She seems happy.

508
Phil sounds like an all right guy.

509
Yeah, he is.

510
All right.

511
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

512
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

513
You're gonna get frostbite!

514
I don't even know.

515
Yeah. Hey!

516
La Push, baby. You in?

517
Should I know what that means?

518
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

519
Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.

520
And I don't just surf the Internet.

521
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

522
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.

523
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

524
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?

525
Seriously, dude.
It's creepy, man.

526
What?
That's what it's called.

527
So...

528
Edible art?

529
Bella.

530
Thanks.

531
You know, your mood swings are kind of giving me whiplash.

532
I only said it'd be better if we weren't friends,
not that I didn't wanna be.

534
What does that mean?

535
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

536
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake that I'm not smart.

537
Would you tell me the truth?

538
No, probably not.

539
I'd rather hear your theories.

540
I have considered radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.

542
That's all superhero stuff, right?

543
What if I'm not the hero?

544
What if I'm the bad guy?

545
You're not.

546
I can see what you're trying to put off,
but I can see that it's just to keep people away from you.

548
It's a mask.

549
Why don't we just hang out?

550
Everybody's going to the beach.

551
Come.

552
I mean, have fun.

553
Which beach?

554
La Push.

555
I don't know.

556
I just...

557
Is there something wrong with that beach?

558
It's just a little crowded.

559
Hey, it's freezing.

560
I'm paddling out, Coates.

561
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

562
We drove all the way out here.

563
I'm at least paddling out.

564
Yeah.

565
She's right.

566
You guys are babies.

567
So, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask me to the prom,
and then he just doesn't.

569
You should ask him.

570
Take control.
You're a strong,
independent woman.

571
I am?

572
Yes.

573
Hey, will you do me up?

574
Yeah.

575
Bella!

576
Hi, Jacob.

577
Guys, this is Jacob.

578
Hey, guys. How you doing?

579
Hi.

580
Hi.

581
What are you, like,
stalking me?

582
You're on my rez,
remember?

583
Are you surfing?

584
Definitely not.

585
Thanks.

586
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

587
What date?

588
She invited Edward.

589
To be polite, that's it.

590
I think it's nice she invited him.

591
Nobody ever does.

592
Yeah,
'cause Cullen's a freak.

593
You got that right.

594
You guys know him?

595
The Cullens don't come here.

596
What did your friends mean about, you know,
"The Cullens don't come here?"

597
You caught that, huh?

598
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

599
Hey, I can keep a secret.

600
Really, it's just like an old scary story.

601
Well, I want to know.

602
Okay, did you know
Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?

603
What? Like, wolves?

604
Yeah.

605
Like, real wolves?

606
Well, that's the legend of our tribe.

607
Okay.

608
So what's the story about the Cullens?

609
Well, they're supposedly descended from this,
like, enemy clan.

610
My great grandfather,
the chief,
found them hunting on our land.

612
But they claimed to be something different,
so we made a treaty with them.

614
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands,
then we wouldn't expose what they really were to the palefaces.

616
I thought they just moved here.

617
Or just moved back.

618
Right.

619
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

620
Well, what are they really?

621
It's just a story, Bella.

622
Come on, let's go.

623
A snake! A snake!

624
♪ My mama said I didn't know how to make a kitty meow ♪

625
Hello?

626
Gerald?

627
Gerald?

628
Hello.

629
Nice jacket.

630
Who are you?

631
It's always the same inane questions.

632
"Who are you?"

633
"What do you want?"

634
"Why are you doing this?"

635
James,
let's not play with our food.

636
He's not here.

637
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

638
What, do they just ditch?

639
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for, like,
hiking and camping and stuff.

640
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.

641
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.

642
I just asked him.
I took control.

643
I told you that would happen.

644
Are you sure you have to go out of town?

645
Oh, yeah,
it's a little family thing.

646
Okay,
we should go shopping in Port Angeles before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

648
Port Angeles?
You mind if I come?

649
Yeah, I need your opinion.

650
I like this one.

651
That's cool.

652
But, like,
I don't know about the one-shoulder thing.

653
I like this one.

654
Yeah,
I like the beading,
and you wouldn't need jewelry.

656
Jess, what do you think?
Lavender?

657
Is that good?
Is that my color?

658
I like it.

659
I liked that dusty rose one, too.

660
Okay, I like this one.

661
It makes my boobs look good.

662
Hey.

663
Right?

664
Nice.

665
Oh, God.

666
That is uncomfortable.

667
That's disgusting.

668
Bella,
what do you think?

669
Yes?

670
That looks great.

671
You said that about,
like, the last five dresses, though.

672
I thought they were all pretty good.

673
You're not really into this, are you?

674
I actually really just want to go to this bookstore.

675
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?

676
Are you sure?

677
Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.

678
Okay.

679
Okay.

680
She's right, though.
This looks awesome.

681
There you go.

682
Have a good night.

683
Thank you.

684
Saw you in the dress store.

685
Hey, where you running to?

686
There she is.

687
What's up?

688
It's my girl.

689
How you guys doing?

690
Look who we just found.

691
What's up, girl?
Hey... Where you going?

692
Where are you going?

693
Come get a drink with us.

694
Yeah, you should hang out with us.

695
Come on.

696
It's fun.

697
What's the problem?

698
She doesn't like that, man.

699
You're pretty.

700
Don't touch me.

701
Cute.

702
Really, no.
Seriously, you should.

703
Don't touch me.

704
Get in the car.

705
That was a very dangerous maneuver.

706
I should go back there and rip those guys'
heads off.

707
No, you shouldn't.

708
You don't know the vile,
repulsive things they were thinking.

709
And you do?

710
It's not hard to guess.

711
Can you talk about something else?

712
Distract me so
I won't turn around.

713
You should put your seatbelt on.

714
You should put your seatbelt on.

715
I thought the salad was pretty good.

716
Hey, you guys,
I'm sorry. I just...

717
Where were you?
We left you messages.

718
Yeah, we waited,
but we were, like,
starving, so we...

719
I'm sorry I kept
Bella from dinner.

720
We just sort of ran into each other and got talking.

721
Yeah.

722
No.

723
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

724
Yeah, we were...

725
We were, yeah,
we were just leaving. So...

726
Let's get this...

727
Bella, if you wanna...

728
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

729
If you'd like.

730
I'll drive you home myself.

731
That's so thoughtful.

732
It's really thoughtful.
Yeah.

733
Yeah.
I should eat something.

734
Yeah.

735
Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.

736
Okay, yeah.

737
See ya.

738
Okay.

739
All right,
one mushroom ravioli.

740
Thanks.

741
Yeah, no problem.

742
So are you sure there isn't anything
I can get for you?

743
No. No, thank you.

744
Let me know.

745
You're really not gonna eat?

746
No, I'm on a special diet.

747
You gotta give me some answers.

748
Yes, no.

749
To get to the other side.

750
1.77245...

751
I don't want to know what the square root of pi is.

752
You knew that?

753
How did you know where I was?

754
I didn't.

755
All right.

756
What?

757
Don't leave. I...

758
Did you follow me?

759
I feel very protective of you.

760
So you followed me.

761
I was trying to keep a distance unless you needed my help,
and then I heard what those low-lifes were thinking.

763
Wait.

764
You say you heard what they were thinking?

765
So what, you...

766
You read minds?

767
I can read every mind in this room.

768
Apart from yours.

769
There's money, sex,
money,
sex,
cat.

773
And then you, nothing.

774
It's very frustrating.

775
Is there something wrong with me?

776
See, I tell you
I can read minds,
and you think there's something wrong with you.

778
What is it?

779
I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.

780
Then don't.

781
Okay, I think
I'm warm enough now.

782
Your hand is so cold.

783
Whoa!

784
What is going on?

785
My dad's still here.

786
Can you pull in?

787
That's my father's car on the end.

788
What is he doing here?

789
Carlisle,
what's going on?

790
Waylon Forge was found in a boat out near his place.

791
I just examined the body.

792
He died?

793
How?

794
Animal attack.

795
Was it the same one that got that security guard down in Mason?

796
Most likely.

797
Well, it's getting closer to town, then.

798
Bella, you should go inside.

799
Waylon was your father's friend.

800
Okay.

801
I'll see you later.

802
Hey.

803
Hey.

804
Dad, I'm really sorry.

805
I've known him going on 30 years.

806
Don't worry,
we're gonna find this thing.

807
Meantime,

808
I want you to carry this with you.

809
I don't know if you...

810
It'll give your old man some peace of mind.

811
Okay.

812
Let's go home.

813
Cold One.

814
You're impossibly fast and strong.

815
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.

816
Your eyes change color.

817
And sometimes you speak like you're from a different time.

818
You never eat or drink anything.

819
You don't go out in the sunlight.

820
How old are you?

821
Seventeen.

822
How long have you been 17?

823
A while.

824
I know what you are.

825
Say it.

826
Out loud.

827
Say it.

828
Vampire.

829
Are you afraid?

830
No.

831
Then ask me the most basic question.

832
What do we eat?

833
You won't hurt me.

834
Where are we going?

835
Up the mountain.

836
Out of the cloud bank.

837
You need to see what I look like in the sunlight.

838
This is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.

839
People would know we're different.

840
This is what I am.

841
It's like diamonds.

842
You're beautiful.

843
Beautiful?

844
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

845
I'm a killer.

846
I don't believe that.

847
That's because you believe the lie.

848
It's camouflage.

849
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

850
Everything about me invites you in,
my voice, my face,
even my smell.

852
As if I would need any of that.

853
As if you could outrun me!

854
As if you could fight me off.

855
I'm designed to kill.

856
I don't care.

857
I've killed people before.

858
It does not matter.

859
I wanted to kill you.

860
I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.

861
I trust you.

862
Don't.

863
I'm here. I trust you.

864
My family,
we're different from others of our kind.

865
We only hunt animals.

866
We've learned to control our thirst.

867
But it's you, your scent,
it's like a drug to me.

869
You're like my own personal brand of heroin.

870
Why did you hate me so much when we met?

871
I did.

872
Only for making me want you so badly.

873
I still don't know if I can control myself.

874
I know you can.

875
I can't read your mind.

876
You have to tell me what you're thinking.

877
Now I'm afraid.

878
Good.

879
I'm not afraid of you.

880
I'm only afraid of losing you.

881
I feel like you're gonna disappear.

882
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

883
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.

884
What a stupid lamb.

885
What a sick,
masochistic lion.

886
About three things
I was absolutely positive.

887
First,

888
Edward was a vampire.

889
Second,
there was a part of him,
and I didn't know how dominant that part might be,
that thirsted for my blood.

893
And third,

894
I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

895
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

896
Gambling, tuxedos,
and Bond, James Bond.

897
Oh, my God.

898
Wow.

899
You know,
everybody's staring.

900
Not that guy.
No, he just looked.

901
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

902
Since I'm going to hell.

903
So, does a person have to be dying to become like you?

905
No, that's just Carlisle.

906
He'd never do this to someone who had another choice.

907
So, how long have you been like this?

908
Since 1918.

909
That's when Carlisle found me dying of Spanish influenza.

910
What was it like?

911
The venom was excruciating.

912
But what Carlisle did was much harder.

913
Not many of us have the restraint to do that.

914
But didn't he just have to bite?

915
Not exactly.

916
When we taste human blood,
a sort of frenzy begins,
and it's almost impossible to stop.

919
But Carlisle did.

920
First with me and then with his wife, Esme.

921
So is Carlisle the real reason that you don't kill people?

922
No, he's not the only reason.

923
I don't want to be a monster.

924
My family,
we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right,

925
'cause we only survive on the blood of animals.

926
But it's...

927
It's like a human only living on tofu.

928
It keeps you strong,
but you're never fully satisfied.

929
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood,
for instance.

930
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

931
Yeah.

932
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.

933
Can the rest of your family read people's minds like you can?

934
No. That's just me.

935
But Alice can see the future.

936
I bet she saw me coming.

937
Alice's visions are subjective.

938
I mean, the future can always change.

939
Could you act human?

940
I mean,
I've got neighbors.

941
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

942
Thanks.

943
Wait, like,
with your family?

944
Yeah.

945
What if they don't like me?

946
So, you're worried not because you'll be in a house full of vampires,
but because you think they won't approve of you?

948
I'm glad I amuse you.

949
What is it?

950
Complication.

951
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

952
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

953
Looks good.
Got that dent out.

954
Yeah.

955
Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

956
First Mariners game of the season.

957
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about seeing you again.

958
Great, Dad. Thanks.

959
Just keeping it real, son.

960
Vitamin R.

961
Well done, Chief.

962
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

963
Good man.

964
Any luck with that Waylon case?

965
Well, I don't think it was an animal that killed him.

966
Never thought it was.

967
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?

968
Keep the kids out of the woods.

969
Will do.

970
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

971
Whoa.

972
This is incredible.

973
It's so light and open,
you know?

974
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?

975
No, not the moats.

976
Not the moats.

977
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

978
I told them not to do this.

979
You add a little bit of olive oil to a non-stick saute pan,
and you want to cook with the olive oil in medium-high heat.

981
What I do,
I cut this in strips,
and then we gonna cut this...

982
Is she even Italian?

983
Her name is Bella.

984
I'm sure she'll love it,
no matter what.

985
Get a whiff of that.

986
Here comes the human.

987
Bella, we're making
Italiano for you.

988
Bella, this is Esme.

989
My mother for all intents and purposes.

990
You've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.

991
I hope you're hungry.

992
Yeah, absolutely.

993
She already ate.

994
Perfect.

995
Yeah, it's just because
I know that you guys don't eat...

996
Of course. It's very considerate of you.

997
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.

998
Yeah.

999
Let's just keep pretending like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

1000
I would never tell anybody anything.

1001
She knows that.

1002
Yeah, well,
the problem is, you two have gone public now, so...

1003
Emmett.

1004
No, she should know.

1005
The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.

1006
Badly, as in...

1007
I would become the meal.

1008
Hi, Bella.

1009
I'm Alice.

1010
Hi.

1011
Hi.

1012
You do smell good.

1013
Alice, what are you...

1014
It's okay.
Bella and I are gonna be great friends.

1015
Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

1016
It's a little difficult for him.

1017
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1018
It's okay, Jasper.
You won't hurt her.

1019
All right, I'm gonna take you on a tour of the rest of the house.

1020
Okay.

1021
Well, I'll see you soon.

1022
Okay.

1023
Cute!

1024
I know.

1025
I think that went well.

1026
Clean this up. Now.

1027
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

1028
I don't know.

1029
Graduation caps?

1030
Yeah. It's a private joke.

1031
We matriculate a lot.

1032
That's kind of miserable.

1033
I mean,
repeating high school over and over.

1034
True, but the younger we start out in a new place,
the longer we can stay there.

1036
Come on.

1037
Yeah, this is my room.

1038
No bed?

1039
No, I don't...

1040
I don't sleep.

1041
Ever?

1042
No, not at all.

1043
Okay.

1044
Boy, you have so much music.

1045
What are you listening to?

1046
It's Debussy.

1047
I don't know...

1048
Yeah.

1049
Claire De Lune  is great.

1050
What?

1051
I can't dance.

1052
Well, I could always make you.

1053
I'm not scared of you.

1054
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.

1055
You better hold on tight,
spider monkey.

1056
Do you trust me?

1057
In theory.

1058
Then close your eyes.

1059
What?

1060
This isn't real.

1061
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

1062
It does in my world.

1063
Hold up.

1064
It's human.

1065
Arizona.
Yo, what's happening?

1066
So you and Cullen, huh?

1067
That's...
I don't like it.

1068
I mean, I don't know,
he just looks at you like you're something to eat.

1070
Here's your veggie plate, Stephenie.

1071
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Biology project.

1072
I ordered you the spinach salad.

1073
I hope that's okay.

1074
You should order one for yourself next time.

1075
Cut back on the steak.

1076
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

1077
Say, Chief,
boys want to know,
did you find anything down by Queets River today?

1079
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint,
but it looks like whoever that is,
is headed east,
so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take over from here.

1082
Okay.

1083
Okay?

1084
I just hope they catch him fast.

1085
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

1086
It's okay if you wanna go join them.

1087
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.

1088
Me, too.

1089
Bella, it's Friday night.
Go out.

1090
Looks like the Newton boy's got a big smile for you.

1091
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

1092
What about any of these other yahoos in town?

1093
Anybody interest you?

1094
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?

1095
Yeah, I guess not.

1096
I just feel like
I leave you alone too much.

1097
You should be around people.

1098
I don't really mind being alone.

1099
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.

1100
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

1101
Phil's working so hard.

1102
You know,
spring training.

1103
We're looking for a house to rent in case things become more permanent.

1104
You'd like Jacksonville,
baby.

1105
Yeah?

1106
I'm really liking Forks.

1107
What?

1108
Forks is growing on me.

1109
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

1110
Well, yeah.

1111
I knew it.
Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

1112
I bet he's smart.
Is he smart?

1113
Mom, can I talk to you later?

1114
Come on,
we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

1115
How did you get in here?

1116
The window.

1117
Do you do that a lot?

1118
Well, just the past couple of months.

1119
I like watching you sleep.

1120
It's kind of fascinating to me.

1121
I always want to try one thing.

1122
Just stay very still.

1123
Don't move.

1124
Stop it!

1125
I'm sorry.

1126
I'm stronger than I thought.

1127
Yeah. I wish
I could say the same.

1128
I can't ever lose control with you.

1129
Hey, don't go.

1130
Hey, got you another one.

1131
Thanks.

1132
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

1133
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

1134
No.

1135
He's a junior.
I'm a junior.

1136
I thought you liked the Cullens.

1137
I thought you didn't like any of the boys in town.

1138
Edward doesn't live in town.

1139
Technically.

1140
He's right outside.

1141
He is?

1142
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.

1143
All right. Bring him in.

1144
Could you be nice?

1145
He's important.

1146
Chief Swan.

1147
I want to formally introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

1148
Hi, Edward.

1149
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

1150
She's just gonna play baseball with my family.

1151
Baseball?

1152
Yes, sir,
that's the plan.

1153
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1154
Well, good luck with that.

1155
I'll take good care of her.
I promise.

1156
Hey.

1157
Still got that pepper spray?

1158
Yeah, Dad.

1159
And since when do vampires like baseball?

1160
Well,
it's the American pastime,
and there's a thunderstorm coming.

1162
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.

1163
Hey.

1164
Glad you're here.
We need an umpire.

1165
She thinks we cheat.

1166
I know you cheat.

1167
Call them as you see them, Bella.

1168
Okay.

1169
It's time.

1170
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.

1171
That's gotta be a home run, right?

1172
Edward's very fast.

1173
♪ Ooh, baby,
don't you know I suffer?

1174
♪ Ooh, baby,
I'm a fool for you

1175
Come home, Rosalie!

1176
You're out.

1177
Out!

1178
Babe, come on.
It's just a game.

1180
Nice kitty.

1187
What are you doing?

1192
My monkey man.

1193
Stop!

1194
They were leaving.
Then they heard us.

1195
Let's go.

1196
It's too late.

1197
Get your hair down.

1198
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.

1199
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

1200
What? What are you...

1201
Just be quiet and stand behind me.

1202
I believe this belongs to you.

1203
Thank you.

1204
I am Laurent.

1205
And this is Victoria and James.

1207
I'm Carlisle.
This is my family.

1208
Hello.

1209
I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.

1211
Our apologies.

1212
We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.

1213
Yes, well,
we maintain a permanent residence nearby.

1214
Really?

1215
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1216
We were just passing through.

1217
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1218
You should be safe.

1219
Excellent.

1220
So,
could you use three more players?

1222
Come on. Just one game.

1223
Sure. Why not?

1224
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1225
We'll bat first.

1226
I'm the one with the wicked curveball.

1227
Well, I think we can handle that.

1228
We shall see.

1229
You brought a snack.

1230
A human?

1231
The girl is with us.

1232
I think it best if you leave.

1233
I can see the game is over.

1234
We'll go now.

1235
James.

1236
Get Bella out of here.

1237
Go.

1238
Okay, I've got it!
I've got it!
I'm all right!

1239
What,
now he's coming after me?

1240
Listen to me.
James is a tracker.

1241
The hunt is his obsession.

1242
I read his mind.

1243
My reaction on the field set him off.

1244
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1245
He's never gonna stop.

1246
What should we do?

1247
We have to kill him.

1248
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1249
Where we going?

1250
Away from Forks.

1251
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.

1252
I have to go home. Now.

1253
You have to take me home.

1254
You can't go home.

1255
He's just gonna trace your scent there.

1256
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1257
But my dad is there. We...

1258
It doesn't matter!

1259
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!

1260
Just let me get you out of here first,
all right?

1261
It's my dad!
We have to go back!

1262
We'll figure a way to lead the tracker away somehow.

1263
I don't know.
But we have to do something.

1264
Edward,
I said leave me alone.

1265
Bella, don't do this, please.

1266
It's over! Get out!

1267
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1268
Bella? What's going on?

1269
I just gotta get out of here.
I'm leaving now.

1270
Hey.

1271
Bella?

1272
What am I gonna say to him?

1273
I can't hurt him.

1274
Bella, what's going on?

1275
You just have to.

1276
I'll be down at the truck.

1277
Did he hurt you?

1278
No.

1279
Break up with you or something?

1280
No, I broke up with him.

1281
I thought you liked him.

1282
Yeah, that's why
I have to leave.

1283
I don't want this.
I have to go home.

1284
Home? Your...

1285
Your mom's not even in Phoenix.

1286
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1287
You're not gonna drive home right now.

1288
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,

1289
I'll take you to the airport.

1290
No. I want to drive.

1291
It'll give me more time to think.

1292
I mean,
if I get really tired,

1293
I'll pull into a motel.
I promise.

1294
Look, Bella,
I know I'm not that much fun to be around,
but I can change that.

1296
We can do more stuff together.

1297
Like what?

1298
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?

1299
Eat at the diner every night?

1300
Steak and cobbler?

1301
Dad, that's you.
That's not me.

1302
Bella, come on,
I just...

1303
I just got you back.

1304
Yeah, and, you know,
if I don't get out now,
then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.

1306
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1307
Why don't you let me drive?

1308
He won't.

1309
You should've seen his face.

1310
I told him the same thing that my mom told him when she was leaving him.

1312
It's the only way he'd let you go.

1313
Just don't worry about him now.

1314
He's safe.
The tracker's following us.

1315
Oh, God.

1316
It's just Emmett.

1317
Alice is in the car behind us.

1318
Wait.

1319
He came to warn us about James.

1320
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,
but he's got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1322
I've never seen anything like him in my 300 years.

1323
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1324
I've had to fight our kind before.

1325
We're not easy to kill.

1326
But not impossible.

1327
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.

1328
I don't relish the thought of killing another creature,
even a sadistic one like James.

1330
What if he kills one of us first?

1331
I'm gonna run
Bella south.

1332
Can you lead the tracker away from here?

1333
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.

1334
He'll follow you.

1335
I'll go with Bella.

1336
Jasper and I
will drive her south.

1337
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1338
Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?

1339
Yes.

1340
Rosalie, Esme,
could you put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1342
Why? What is she to me?

1343
Rosalie,
Bella is with Edward.

1344
She's part of this family now,
and we protect our family.

1346
Oh, God. If anything...

1347
What if...

1348
If anything happens,
I swear to God...

1349
Nothing's gonna happen.

1350
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1352
Yeah.

1353
Bella,
you are my life now.

1354
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1355
You must have let your phone die or something.

1356
I'm not in Forks,
but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1357
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1358
That's good.

1359
What is it?
What do you see?

1360
He's figured it out.

1361
The tracker,
he just changed course.

1362
Where will it take him, Alice?

1363
Mirrors.

1364
A room full of mirrors.

1365
Edward said the visions weren't always certain.

1366
She sees the course people are on while they're on it.

1367
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1368
Okay, so the course that the tracker's on now is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?

1370
You've been here?

1371
I took lessons as a kid.

1372
The school I went to had an arch just like that.

1373
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1374
Yeah.

1375
Edward, are you okay?

1376
We've lost the tracker.

1377
The woman's still in the area.

1378
Rosalie and Esme are going back to Forks to protect your father.

1379
I'm coming to get you.
Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1380
And the others will keep hunting.

1381
I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.

1382
Hey, Mom,
I'm glad you got my message.

1383
What are you doing home?

1384
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1385
Calm down,
everything's fine.

1386
Bella? Bella?

1387
I'll explain everything later.

1388
Mom, are you there?

1389
Forks High School doesn't protect its students'
privacy very well.

1390
It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.

1391
It's a nice house you have here.

1392
I was prepared to wait for you,
but then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your dad,
and it all worked out quite well.

1395
Wait, wait...

1396
Don't touch her! Don't...

1397
You can still save her.

1398
Don't!

1399
But you're gonna have to get away from your friends.

1400
Can you handle that?

1401
Where should I meet you?

1402
How about your old ballet studio?

1403
And I'll know if you bring anyone along.

1404
Poor Mommy would pay the price for that mistake.

1405
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.

1406
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.

1407
I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face-to-face with death.

1409
They also brought me to Edward.

1410
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1411
Mom?

1412
Bella?

1413
Mom?

1414
There you are.

1415
What are you doing in here?

1416
Everyone makes fun of me.

1417
Come on,
you're a wonderful dancer.

1418
Mom, I suck.

1419
You do not suck.

1420
That's my favorite part.

1421
You were a stubborn child,
weren't you?

1422
She's not even here.

1423
No.

1424
Sorry.

1425
You know, but you really made it too easy.

1426
So to make things more entertaining,

1427
I'm gonna make a little film of our time together.

1428
I borrowed this from your house.

1429
I hope you don't mind.

1430
Good.

1431
And action.

1433
That'll break
Edward's little heart.

1434
You have...

1435
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1436
But he does.

1437
His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.

1439
And let's continue.

1440
Beautiful.
Very visually dynamic.

1441
I chose my stage well.

1442
It's too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.

1443
Instead, he kept you this fragile little human.

1444
It's cruel, really.

1445
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1446
Tell him to avenge you.
Tell him!

1447
No, Edward, don't!

1448
Tell him! Tell him!

1449
You're alone
'cause you're faster than the others.

1450
But not stronger.

1451
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1452
I'm sorry.

1453
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1454
Son. Enough.

1455
Remember who you are.

1456
Bella, you're okay.

1457
Bella needs you.

1458
It's okay.

1459
Oh, God.

1460
Carlisle? Her blood.

1461
Your brothers will take care of him.

1462
I got him.

1463
Carlisle!

1464
Start the fire.

1465
Get the floorboards.

1466
Alice!

1467
Alice, go.

1468
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1469
No, no, my head is burning!

1470
It's the venom.

1471
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.

1472
No.

1473
No.

1474
It's gonna happen, Edward.
I've seen it.

1475
It doesn't have to be that way.

1476
She's still hemorrhaging.

1477
Alice,
make me a tourniquet.
Your belt.

1478
Carlisle,
what's my other option?

1479
Tie it above my hands.

1480
Carlisle!

1481
Go.

1482
We could try to suck the venom out.

1483
You know I won't be able to stop.

1484
Then find the will to stop.

1485
But choose.

1486
She only has minutes left.

1487
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.

1488
I'm gonna make it go away.

1489
Edward, stop.

1490
Her blood is clean.
You're killing her.

1491
Edward.

1492
Stop.

1493
Stop.

1494
Find the will.

1495
Death is peaceful, easy.

1496
Life is harder.

1497
Bella?

1498
Baby?

1499
Bella.

1500
Mom?

1501
Hey.

1502
Where is he?

1503
Where's...

1504
Where's Edward?

1505
He's asleep.

1506
He never leaves.

1507
And your dad,
he's down at the cafeteria.

1508
What happened?

1509
Well, when you fell,
you broke your leg,
and you lost a lot of blood.

1511
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1512
Edward came down with his dad to try to convince you to come back to Forks.

1514
So you went over to their hotel,
then you tripped,
and you fell down two flights of stairs.

1516
Went through a window.

1517
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1518
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1519
It's Phil.

1520
He's so worried about you.

1521
You're texting.

1522
Finally, yeah.

1523
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1524
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day,
and we found the cutest little house,
and you've got your own bathroom.

1527
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.

1528
What?

1529
I want to live in Forks.

1530
Well, okay,
but we'll talk about it.

1531
Do you mind getting Dad?

1532
I have to talk to him.
Apologize.

1533
Okay, baby.
I'll go get him.

1534
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?

1535
Okay.

1536
So what happened?

1537
Where's James?

1538
We took care of it.

1539
And the woman,
Victoria, she ran off.

1540
I'm alive because of you.

1541
No, you're in here because of me.

1542
The worst part of it was that

1543
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1544
You did stop.

1545
Bella,
you gotta go to Jacksonville so I can't hurt you anymore.

1546
What?

1547
Are you... No!

1548
No!

1549
I don't even know what you're... How...

1550
What are you talking about?

1551
You want me to go away?
I can't...

1552
No, I can't...
I can't just leave you...

1553
I know.

1554
We can't be apart.

1555
You can't leave me.

1556
I'm here.

1557
Okay, just don't...

1558
You just can't say stuff like that to me. Ever.

1559
Where else am I gonna go?

1560
Alice lent me the dress.

1561
The cast is...

1562
You're perfect.

1563
I'll take care of her,
Chief Swan.

1564
Uh-huh.
I've heard that before.

1565
All right, Bells.

1566
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.

1567
Dad.

1568
And...

1569
Well, you look beautiful.

1570
Thanks.

1571
See you.

1572
Hey. I'll be right back.

Bella.

1574
Jacob.

1575
Hey.

1576
Nice.

1577
You, too.

1578
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1579
No.

1580
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1581
Twenty bucks.

1582
Let's hear it.

1583
Just don't get mad, okay?

1584
He wants you to break up with your boyfriend.

1585
It's just, he said, quote,

1586
"We'll be watching you."

1587
Okay, well,
tell him, "Thanks."

1588
Okay.

1589
And to pay up.

1590
Okay. Let me help you.

1591
Jacob.

1592
I'll take it from here.

1593
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1594
All right.

1595
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1596
I can't believe you're making me do this.

1597
Just smile.

1600
Wow. You are really trying to kill me.

1601
The prom is an important rite of passage.

1602
I didn't want you to miss anything.
