1
So beautiful.

2
We're the same temperature now.

4
Hey, Bella, you're a lot stronger than I am right now.

7
It's your turn not to break me.

9
I love you.

10
I love you.

11
Renesmee.

13
She's incredible.

14
Where is she? I have to see her.

15
Wait. Wait.

16
You need to get your thirst under control.

17
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.

19
Close your eyes.

20
What do you hear?

27
Bella, don't!

30
Bella, stop!

31
I'm sorry, I didn't realize there'd be people this far from 
the trails.

33
(ROUGHLY) I have to get outta here.

34
Okay, I can help you.

36
Or not.

39
(CHUCKLES) Well, I'm amazed.

40
You ran away from human blood mid-hunt.

41
Even mature vampires have problems with that.

43
You're still here.

44
So are you.

45
I didn't expect you to seem so you.

47
Except for the creepy eyes.

48
I would keep my distance for now.

49
It's safer for the baby to see how you do with me first.

50
Since when do you care about Renesmee?

51
All right.

52
Take a whiff.

53
Well, I can see what everyone's been talking about.

55
Jake, you really do stink.

57
You guys really look great together.

59
Want to come meet our daughter?

60
Welcome to the family.

61
You look amazing, Bella.

62
Someone's been waiting to meet you.

63
Rose.

65
(WHISPERING) Beautiful.

66
What was that?

67
She showed you the first memory she has of you.

68
Showed me? How?

69
How do I hear thoughts?

70
How does Alice see the future?

71
She's gifted.

72
I've only been out for two days?

73
Her growth rate is unprecedented.

74
All right. That's enough experimenting for one day.

75
Jacob.

76
She's doing great.

77
Yeah. Let's not push it though.

78
What's your problem?

79
Oh.

80
Do tell her, Jacob.

81
This should be good.

82
Hold on a second.

83
Bella.

84
Look, it's a wolf thing.

86
What's a wolf thing?

87
Um....

88
You know we have no control over it.

89
We can't choose who it happens with.

90
And it doesn't mean what you think, Bella. I promise.

91
Take Renesmee out of the room.

92
Oh.

93
Edward, don't touch me right now.

94
I don't want to hurt you.

95
Oh.

96
You imprinted on my daughter?

97
It wasn't my choice!

98
She's a baby!

99
It's not like that.

100
You think Edward would let me live if it was?

101
I'm still debating it.

102
I've held her once!

103
One time, Jacob!

104
And already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her?

106
She's mine!

109
It's fine, Leah.

110
You're gonna stay away from her.

111
You know I can't do that.

114
Stop her, Edward.

115
He said it's fine.

116
She's amazing, right?

117
Do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago?

118
That's gone now, right?

119
Long gone.

120
Because it was her.

121
From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.

122
Nessie?

123
You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?

124
~ (GROWLS)
~ (GRUNTS)

126
Seth, are you okay?

127
Seth, I'm sorry.

129
He'll be all right.

130
Bella, you know me better than anyone.

132
All I want is for Ness....

133
Renesmee to be safe. Happy.

134
Look, nothing ever made sense before.

136
You. Me. Any of it.

137
And now I understand why.

138
This was the reason.

142
Finally.

143
My turn.

144
Where does she sleep?

145
In my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.

146
Happy birthday.

147
I stopped aging three days ago.

148
Well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.

149
I still hate surprises.
That hasn't changed.

150
You'll love this one.

151
Welcome home!

152
We thought you guys might like a place of your own.

153
What do you think?

154
I think it's perfect.

155
Go inside.

156
Have fun.

157
This will be Renesmee's room.

158
Closet.

159
Wow.

160
Alice stocked it for you.

161
~ Clearly.
~ (CHUCKLES)

162
This is our room.

163
Vampires don't sleep.

164
It's not intended for sleep.

167
You really were holding back before.

168
I'm never gonna get enough of this.

169
We don't get tired.

170
We don't have to rest or catch our breath or eat.

171
I mean, how are we gonna stop?

174
Rosalie and Emmett were so bad, it took a solid decade before we could stand to be within five miles of them.

177
I think we might be worse.

178
Definitely worse.

180
Wow.

181
Done already?

182
Where's Renesmee?

183
Blondie stole her.

184
Break a lot of stuff?

185
Emmett.

186
No.

189
Is that Charlie?

190
He's been calling twice a day.

191
He's in pretty rough shape.

192
Eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.

193
He needs to mourn, Bella.

194
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

195
I'm gonna miss this place.

196
We'll come back. We always do.

197
Wait.

198
Nobody said anything about leaving.

199
Once people believe Bella's dead, we can't risk anyone seeing her.

200
So you just disappear?

201
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

202
Hey.

203
You heard anything?

204
Charlie, Bella is....

206
Uh....

207
No, she's not.

208
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine.

209
She's back home and she's feeling better.

211
Why didn't you say so? That's great.

212
Wait.

213
There's something you need to see first.

214
I need to see Bella.

215
Look, in order for Bella to get better, she had to change.

218
What do you mean, "change"?

219
Here goes nothing.

220
What the hell are you doing?

221
You don't live in the world you think you do.

222
Jacob, put your clothes on.

223
Now, this may seem strange.

224
Really strange. But stranger things happen every day.

226
Trust me.

227
Holy shit! (GRUNTS)

229
Look, I solved a problem.

230
You were leaving.

231
What did you expect me to do?

232
You don't realize the danger you've put him in.

233
The Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.

234
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

235
I only said you were different.

236
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

237
I mean, seriously, Jake, he's not just gonna let that go.

238
Did you consider the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

239
It'll be like sticking a white hot branding iron down her throat.

240
And that's assuming she can control her thirst.

241
Look, Charlie's been in hell.

242
And I know you'll be much happier with him in your life.

243
Jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this for anyone 
but yourself.

244
Sorry you feel that way because he'll be here in 10 minutes.

246
What?

247
These will irritate your eyes at first.

248
The main thing is not to move too fast.

249
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

250
Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.

251
And blink at least three times a minute.

252
Good.

253
For a cartoon character.

254
Hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.

255
Just don't forget to move your shoulders so it looks like 
you're breathing.

256
And don't sit so straight.

257
Humans don't do that.

258
Okay. I got it.

259
Move around, blink, slouch.

261
Good luck.

262
Hello, Charlie.

263
Where's Bella?

264
Bella.

265
Hi, Dad.

266
Are you okay?

267
Never better.

268
Healthy as a horse.

269
You don't turn into an animal, too, do you?

270
She wishes she was that awesome.

271
Let's give them some privacy.

272
Uh, Jake said that this....

273
This was necessary.

274
What does that mean?

275
I really think it would be better....

276
I wanna know what happened to you.

277
I can't tell you.

278
I think I deserve an explanation.

279
You do.

280
But if you really need one, I can't stay here.

281
Oh, come on! No!

282
No more going away!

283
Dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason, I'm all right.

285
I'm more than all right.

286
Can you live with that?

287
Can I live with that?

288
Well, I don't know, Bella.

289
I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life turn into a very large dog.

291
My daughter looks like my daughter.

292
But doesn't.

293
Can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that 
you need to know?

294
And I don't need to know this?

295
No.

296
Really, you don't.

297
Well....

298
Not gonna lose you again.

299
I can't.

300
Then you won't.

301
I promise.

302
I missed you, Bells.

303
So much.

304
I missed you, Dad.

305
Charlie.

306
This is Renesmee.

307
Your niece?

308
Our daughter.

309
Right.

310
The adoption.

311
Renee-semee?

312
She's got your eyes, Bella.

313
Need to know, I guess.

314
Well done, Bella.

315
Never seen a newborn show that kind of restraint.

316
I'm not sure she is a newborn.

317
She's so tame.

318
Emmett, don't antagonize her.

319
She's the strongest one in the house.

320
~ (SNORTS) Please.
~ (KNUCKLES CRACKING)

321
Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.

322
All right. On 3.

323
1, 2, ~ 3!
~ (EMMETT GRUNTING)

327
Did you see that?

329
Thank you.

330
My time as a human was over.

331
But I never felt more alive.

332
I was born to be a vampire.

333
Everything was falling into place.

334
Even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status.

335
Though they'd want proof eventually.

336
It seemed we had only one enemy left.

337
Time.

338
Renesmee was growing too fast.

339
We all worried about how long we would have with her.

340
It just made every moment more precious.

341
Look, a snowflake.

342
It's beautiful.

343
Why don't you go get another one?

344
Edward thinks that we'll find answers in Brazil.

345
There are tribes there that might know something.

346
Who was that?

347
I think that's our cousin from Denali.

349
Irina!

350
Tanya convinced lrina to come reconcile with us.

351
It looks like she changed her mind.

352
Seeing Jacob must have been too much for her.

353
Wish I could have just spoken to her.

354
She's family. She'll come around.

358
What a pleasant surprise.

359
What do you want?

360
Hmm?

361
I have to report a crime.

362
The Cullens....

363
They've done something terrible.

364
Allow me, my dear.

365
Oh, my.

367
What is it, Alice?

368
The Volturi.

369
They're coming for us.

370
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.

371
And lrina.

372
Honey, come here.

373
Why?

374
What did lrina see in the woods?

375
We were just walking.

376
Ness was catching snowflakes.

377
Of course.

378
Irina thinks Renesmee's an immortal Child.

379
The immortal Children were very beautiful.

380
So enchanting.

381
To be near them was to love them.

382
But their development was frozen at the age they were turned.

383
They couldn't be taught or restrained.

384
A single tantrum could destroy an entire village.

386
Humans heard about the devastation.

387
Stories spread.

388
The Volturi were forced to intervene.

389
Since the Children couldn't protect our secret, they had to be destroyed.

392
No!

393
(SCREAMING) No!

394
No!

396
Their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them.

398
Long-established covens were torn apart.

399
Countless humans slaughtered.

400
Traditions, friends, even families. Lost.

402
No, no!

403
~ Mother!
~ No!

404
Mother!

407
So the Denalis' mother made an immortal Child?

408
Yes.

409
And she paid the price.

411
Well, Renesmee's nothing like those children.

412
She was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.

413
So can't you just explain that to the Volturi?

414
Aro has enough proof in lrina's thoughts.

415
So we fight.

416
Their offensive weapons are too powerful.

417
No one can stand against Jane.

418
Alec's even worse.

419
Well, then we convince them.

420
They're coming to kill us, not to talk.

421
No, you're right.

422
They won't listen to us.

423
But maybe others can convince them.

424
Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.

425
I won't ask them to fight.

426
Not fight. Witness.

427
If enough people knew the truth, maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.

429
We can ask this of our friends.

430
At least we get to go to London again.

431
We haven't been there in a long time.

432
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

433
Alice asked me to give you that.

434
She and Jasper crossed our lands to the ocean last night.

435
Carlisle?

436
They've left us.

437
Why?

438
She didn't say.

439
Can I see that?

440
Gather as many witnesses as you can before the snow sticks to 
the ground.

441
That's when they'll come.

442
Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained.

443
Why would she and Jasper leave at the moment we needed them most?

444
What did they know?

445
Our search for witnesses began with a trip north to our 
closest relatives.

446
Edward, is everything all right?

447
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

448
Is it lrina?

449
Have you heard from her?

450
Not directly.

451
Why is your bride waiting in the car?

452
And why have you brought a wolf with you?

453
I can smell him from here.

454
My family is in danger. I need your help.

455
What's happened?

456
It's hard to explain but I need you to be open-minded. Can you do that?

458
Of course.

459
Okay.

460
Time to meet some new people.

461
What if they don't like me?

462
~ They'll love you.
~ They will.

463
Once they understand you.

464
They just haven't met anyone like you before.

465
Okay.

467
The Volturi will come for all of us.

468
You get that thing out of here.

469
She's not what she looks like.

470
This is a crime!

473
Stay back!

474
She has blood in her veins.

475
You can feel her warmth.

476
I can feel it.

477
I'm her biological father.

478
~ Bella is her mother.
~ Impossible.

479
It's true. She was born while I was still human.

480
I've never heard of such a thing.

481
She can show you, if you let her.

482
Tanya, you owe us this much.

483
We're all under a death sentence because your sister didn't 
let us explain.

484
Don't be afraid.

485
This is how she communicates.

486
It's true.

487
She's not immortal.

488
I knew the rest of our family would face this fear as well.

489
Fear of the unknown.

490
Fear of the Volturi.

491
Amun, please!

492
I cannot help you, Carlisle.

493
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.

494
You must go.

495
I'd like to hear about it.

496
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.

497
He likes to keep me hidden.

498
I can't imagine why.

499
~ Carlisle.
~ Benjamin.

500
Benjamin can influence the elements.

501
And here I get super self-control.

503
Who are they?

504
Senna and Zafrina.

505
From the Amazon.

506
The arrival of Senna and Zafrina meant that our plea was 
being heard in even the most remote corners of the world while others searched for witnesses closer to home.

510
A patriot Carlisle first met on the battlefield at Yorktown would become our most unlikely ally.

513
Shut up!

514
I hated the first British invasion.

515
And I hate the second one even more.

516
Even the Beatles?

517
Really, Garrett?

518
Old habits die hard.

519
~ Carlisle needs you.
~ (GROANS)

521
Sounds interesting.

522
Help!

523
But first I'd better finish my meal.

524
Help me! Help!

527
Each of them was won over.

528
Each was made to see.

529
Carlisle convinced his Irish friends to make the journey to Forks.

530
Although we were grateful for their help, their thirst for human blood complicated the situation.

532
The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable.

533
Especially Peter who had fought alongside
Jasper as a newborn.

535
Lotta red eyes around here.

536
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

537
But they'll feed somewhere.

538
As more vampires set foot in their territory, more Quileutes turned.

540
Their nature compelling them to join the pack.

542
Hey, easy there. Hey!

543
~ (WHINING)
~ It's all right.

544
You're gonna be okay.

546
Finally, Carlisle and Esme returned with our last witness.

547
~ How many came?
~ Eighteen.

548
You have some good friends.

549
And Alice?

550
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

551
Centuries on the run.
That's what you've brought me.

552
Some friend, Carlisle.

553
Alistair, come meet everyone.

554
I already told you, if it comes to a fight, I won't stand against 
the Volturi.

555
It won't come to a fight.

556
I'll be in the attic.

557
He's not a people person.

558
We opened our home to 18 vampires.

559
Many with gifts of their own.

560
Zafrina had power over the mind.

561
She could make anyone see what she wanted them to.

562
If she weren't holding my hand right now, I could swear this was real.

563
I don't see anything.

564
Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

565
What's a shield?

566
The ones I've met are so different.

567
It's a defensive talent.

568
It's why I couldn't read your mind, even before.

569
It's why Aro couldn't.

570
You have a very powerful gift.

572
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

573
Shoulda put her on her ass.

574
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

575
Maybe it only works on the weak.

576
Garrett, I wouldn't.

577
~ (CRACKLING)
~ (GROANING)

578
You are an amazing woman.

579
Now, you guys can do some serious damage.

580
Which is why you'll need to control your phasing.

581
If your mom pisses you off, you don't want to tear her head off.

582
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.

585
(LAUGHS) Whoopa!

588
Vladimir, Stefan, you're a long way from home.

590
What are they doing here?

591
We heard the Volturi were moving against you.

592
But that you would not stand alone.

593
We didn't do what we were accused of.

594
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

595
We have been waiting a millennium for the ltalian scum to be challenged.

597
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

598
Shame.

599
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

600
They enjoy a good fight. (CHUCKLES)

601
Aro's witnesses?

602
Aww.

603
Still hoping they'll listen?

604
When Aro wants someone 
from a coven it's never long before evidence turns up proving that coven 
committed some crime.

606
So he's done this before?

607
It happens so rarely, I never realized it was a pattern.

608
Apparently he always pardons one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

609
This person always has an ability.

610
And they're always given a place with the Guard.

611
This is all about Alice.

612
~ He has no one like her.
~ Which is why she left.

613
Why does he need witnesses?

614
To spread the word that justice has been served.

615
After he slaughters an entire coven.

616
Benjamin, Tia, ~ we're leaving.
~ And where will you go?

618
What makes you think they'll be satisfied with Alice?

619
What's to stop them from going after Benjamin next?

620
Or Zafrina or Kate or anyone else with a gift? Anyone they want.

622
Their goal isn't punishment, it's power.

623
It's acquisition.

624
Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will.

625
For the sake of my family. But also for yours.

626
And for the way you want to live.

627
The packs will fight.

628
We've never been afraid of vampires.

629
We will fight.

630
This won't be the first time
I fought a king's rule.

631
We'll join you.

632
No.

633
I will do the right thing, Amun.

634
You may do as you please.

635
We will stand with you.

636
So will we.

637
That didn't take much.

638
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

639
We'll see.

640
Everyone showed courage.

641
Though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us.

642
Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.

643
And worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.

648
I refused him!

649
I'm not with Carlisle!

650
Alec?

651
I will never go against you.

652
Of course not, my dear Toshiro.

654
It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.

656
Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.

658
Sad, isn't it?

660
Aro will want us incapacitated before he attacks.

661
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first because I can 
anticipate their moves.

662
Too bad we don't all have your shield.

663
Doesn't help me fight, though.

664
No, but you could help the rest of us, if you could project it.

666
What do you mean?

667
I mean shield someone other than yourself.

668
Is that possible?

669
Gifts can be developed. Over time.

670
At first, mine was just in my palms.

671
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

672
~ How do you do it?
~ (SIGHS)

673
~ Tell me.
~ Ow.

674
You need to visualize it.

675
See how it moves.

676
What color it is.

677
Now picture it expanding.

678
Will it to go beyond you.

680
I think she needs something to motivate her.

681
~ No.
~ It's all right, I can take it.

682
He says that now.

683
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

684
~ Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.
~ (CRACKLING)

686
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

687
Dude, you're not motivating her.

688
You want to try?

689
~ (CRACKLING)
~ (GROANING)

690
Kate!

691
You seem to lack incentive.

692
Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?

693
Are you crazy?

694
All right.

695
This one's on full power.

698
It's painful, but it's bearable.

699
Okay, we should go again.

700
Emmett.

701
I'm good.

702
"There's sweet music here that

703
"softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass.

704
"Or night dews on still waters between walls

705
"of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass.

706
"Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."

707
Mom.

708
Hmm?

709
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away because we're gonna die?

711
No.

712
I think they left to keep us safer.

713
That's what all these other people are here for, too.

714
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

715
Come here. Go to sleep.

716
It's strange.

717
Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.

718
Mentally, I just feel drained.

719
How about a bath?

720
I do remember how to undress myself.

721
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

722
Bella, I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.

724
Every obstacle you've faced, I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

726
And you just did.

727
You're the reason they have something to fight for.

728
My family.

729
I'm gonna get the water running.

730
Alice made sure only I would get the message.

731
Because only my mind would be safe from Aro.

732
I'm surprised you took 
a break from Jedi training.

733
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad, he'll come to us.

734
27 vampires, one human.

735
Not so great.

736
I know that's what you told Edward.

737
~ (EXHALES)
~ Whatever.

738
I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.

740
I'm sorry.

741
I know.

742
They're the good guys.

743
But come on, Dracula One and Two are

745
~ creepy.
~ (BOTH LAUGHING)

746
There she is. Come here.

747
Oh!

748
Wow! Look at you.

749
You've grown half a foot!

750
Seriously.

751
Like 6 inches.

752
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

753
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

754
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

755
I'll be back soon, okay?

756
~ Come on. Let's go.
~ (RENESMEE LAUGHS)

758
Alice's note gave me a 
new sense of hope.

759
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

760
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

761
I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.
Right this way.

762
~ Mrs. Cullen.
~ Hi.

763
I'm so happy you called.

764
I always meet my private clients here.

765
It's more comfortable than the office.

766
And it's more public.

767
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

768
What type of work do you do, J.?

769
Oh, you know, this and that.

770
It's always different, which keeps it interesting.

771
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

772
I've been working with them for more than 20 years.

773
And my late partner knew Jasper 15 years before that.

774
He is, uh, unusually well-preserved.

776
Yes, he is.

777
I trust that Mr. Jasper is enjoying his vacation.

778
He didn't tell you where he was going, did he?

779
No, no, no, he just mentioned that he was leaving when he came by to place his order.

781
I assume that his order is ready?

782
Of course.

783
I've never been late with a delivery.

784
There a problem?

785
No.

786
My husband and I thought that we'd all be traveling together.

787
Jasper said only two were traveling.

788
His instructions were very clear.

789
It's my mistake.

790
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

791
Alice's vision was clear.

792
Renesmee would have a future.

793
But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.

794
How ya doin'?

796
"My dearest Renesmee, "I thought we would have forever together.

798
"But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped.

799
"I know now why Alice left me clues.

800
"It was to keep you safe.

801
"Everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack.

802
"Jacob will protect you.

803
"And he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends. "

804
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

805
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

806
I must admit, you even had me believing.

807
For a moment.

809
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

810
Cheers.

811
The snow is sticking.

812
Hey, we still have today.

813
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.

814
Bella, no one's giving up here.

815
All right! Present time! Let's go!

816
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

817
Jake, you start. Get it going.

818
What did you get me?
I'm not giving you anything.

819
Hey! No, come on, what did you get me?

820
Well, Dad, we didn't 
have time to wrap yours, but here it is.

822
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

823
It's for you and Sue.

824
You leave tomorrow.

825
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

826
Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.

827
I made arrangements for you at work.

828
Sneaky.

829
And extravagant.

830
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

831
You two trying to get rid of me?

832
Because it's working! (CHUCKLES)

833
Fraser River.
That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

834
We might even hook a Rainbow or some Bulls.

835
Woman knows her trout.

836
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

837
Jacob make this for you?

838
Wanna put it on?

839
It's so pretty.

840
It is really pretty.

841
That's what I'm talkin' about.

842
A little pre-battle bonfire.

843
Telling war stories.

844
Or just standing there like frickin' statues.

845
Name any American battle. I was there.

846
Little Bighorn.

847
I came this close to biting Custer.

848
But the lndians got him first.

849
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

850
He didn't win that one on his own.

851
If you're talking battles, you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

853
No one does rebellion like the lrish.

854
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

855
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

856
When we ruled, everything came to us.

857
Prey, diplomats, favor seekers.

860
Such was our power.

861
But we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.

862
We were honest about what we were.

863
We sat still for a very long time.

864
We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.

865
Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they burned our castles.

867
We've been waiting 1,500 years to return that favor.

869
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

870
I can't help thinking, all these people are putting themselves in danger because I fell in love with a human.

873
You found your mate.

874
You deserve to be happy.

875
But at what cost?

876
Everyone here has something to fight for.

877
I certainly do.

878
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

879
For this extraordinary life.

880
This means "More than my own life."

881
That's how much I love you.

882
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob.

883
No matter what.

884
Even if I tell him that....

885
That he has to take you somewhere.

886
Hey.

887
Baby, it's all right.

888
You're gonna be safe.

889
Always.

890
If we live through this, I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

892
Now you tell me.

893
The Redcoats are coming!
The Redcoats are coming!

894
Aro's looking for Alice.

899
Aro, let us discuss things as we used to.

901
In a civilized manner.

902
Fair words, Carlisle.

903
But a little out of place, given the battalion you've assembled against us.

905
I can promise you, that was never my intent.

906
No laws have been broken.

907
We see the child.

908
Do not treat us as fools.

909
She is not an immortal!

910
These witnesses can attest to that.

911
Or you can look.

912
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

913
Artifice!

914
I will collect every facet of the truth.

915
But from someone more central to the story.

916
Edward, as the child clings to your newborn mate, I assume you are involved.

919
I'd like to meet her.

921
Ah.

922
Young Bella.

923
Immortality becomes you.

926
I hear her strange heart.

928
Hello, Aro.

929
Magnifico!

930
Half mortal, half immortal.

932
Conceived and carried by this newborn while she was still human.

935
Impossible!

936
Do you think they fooled me, brother?

938
Bring the informer forward.

939
Is that the child you saw?

940
I'm not sure.

941
Jane.

942
She's changed. This child is bigger.

943
Then your allegations were false.

944
The Cullens are innocent.

945
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

946
I'm sorry.

947
Caius, no!

948
Irina!

950
~ (CRACKLING)
~ (BOTH GRUNT)

953
Blind them.

954
Give me my sight back.

955
Tanya, this is what they want.

956
If you attack now, we'll all die.

957
~ Pain.
~ (GRUNTING IN PAIN)

958
It's working.

960
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.

961
Agreed.

962
But does it then follow that there is no danger?

964
For the first time in our history humans pose a threat to our kind.

967
Their modern technology has given birth to weapons that could destroy us.

969
Maintaining our secret has never been more imperative.

971
In such perilous times, only the known is safe.

974
Only the known is tolerable.

976
And we know nothing of what this child will become.

978
Can we live with such uncertainty?

979
Spare ourselves a fight today, only to die

981
~ tomorrow.
~ (ALL CHATTERING)

982
No.

984
Alice.

985
Alice!

986
My dear, dear Alice, we're so glad to see you here, after all.

988
I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.

989
Let me show you.

990
Brother?

992
It doesn't matter what I show you.

993
Even when you see.

994
You still won't change your decision.

995
Now!

996
Take care of my daughter.

997
Get them.

998
Hmm!

999
Take her away.

1000
Let her go!

1015
Jacob!

1016
~ Jacob!
~ (WHIMPERING)

1017
Jacob!

1018
Jacob!

1020
Watch out!

1023
(GRUNTS) Bella!

1028
Finally.

1029
Now you know.

1030
That's your future.

1031
Unless you decide on another course.

1032
We cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.

1033
But what if you were sure she could remain concealed from the human world?

1035
Could we leave in peace?

1036
Of course. But that cannot be known.

1037
Actually, it can.

1038
I've been searching for witnesses of my own among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

1040
~ We have enough witnesses.
~ Let him speak, brother.

1041
I am half human, half vampire.

1043
Like the child.

1044
A vampire seduced my mother, who died giving birth to me.

1046
My aunt Huilen raised me as her own.

1048
I made her immortal.

1049
How old are you?

1050
150 years.

1051
At what age did you reach maturity?

1052
I became full-grown seven years after my birth.

1053
I have not changed since then.

1054
And your diet?

1055
Blood, human food.

1057
I can survive on either.

1058
These children are much like us.

1059
Regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves.

1060
Our natural enemies.

1061
Dear ones, there is no danger here.

1063
We will not fight today.

1065
Such a prize.

1066
We have them on the run.
Now is the time to attack.

1067
Not today.

1068
You're all fools!

1069
The Volturi might be gone.

1070
But they will never forgive what happened here.

1075
You have a beautiful family.

1076
She's gonna be around for a long time, isn't she?

1077
A very long time.

1078
I'm glad she has you.

1079
So should I start calling you "Dad"?

1080
No.

1081
Hey.

1082
Hey.

1083
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

1084
I wanna show you something.

1085
What?

1086
I'm Edward Cullen.

1087
How did you do that?

1088
Been practicing.

1089
Now you know.

1090
Nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.

1091
There's one exception.

1092
Will you show me again?

1093
We've got a lotta time.

1094
Forever.

1095
Forever.
