1
Ah!

2
Valentina has brought us something.

3
She should not have interrupted.

4
She's new.

5
Aren't they all?

6
Ah!

8
Edward and Bella are to be married.

9
What joy!

10
This is the Cullens' way of announcing her transformation.

11
They mock us with their delays.

12
Patience, brother.

13
Though you do have a point.

14
The human did interrupt.

15
Oh, I do love weddings.

16
No!

17
"Childhood is not from birth to a certain age.

18
"And at a certain age, the child is grown and puts away childish things.

19
"Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies."

20
Jake! Jacob!

22
Phil!

23
It's happening.

25
You just have to break them in.

26
I've been breaking them in.
For three days.

27
Can I just go barefoot?

28
No, absolutely not.

29
Just thinking it's a little much, you know?

30
The dress and the shoes, and all of this.

32
No, it's exactly enough.

33
Tomorrow will be perfect.

34
Where do you want them, boss?

35
On either side of the aisle.

36
What aisle?
Does no one have vision?

37
You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep.

38
That's an order.

39
Okay.

40
I was just checking for cold feet.

41
Well, mine are toasty warm.

42
It's not too late to change your mind.

43
What? Now you're having second thoughts?

44
You are.

45
No, I've been waiting a century to marry you, Miss Swan.

46
But?

47
But?

48
I haven't told you everything about myself.

49
What? You're not a virgin?

52
Look, you can't scare me away now.

53
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me, I rebelled against him.

55
I resented him for curbing my appetite.

56
And so for a while, I went off on my own.

57
I wanted to know how it felt to hunt.

60
To taste human blood.

63
All the men I killed were monsters.

65
And so was I.

66
Edward, they were all murderers.

67
You probably saved more lives than you took.

68
Bella, that's what
I told myself.

69
But they were all human beings.

70
I looked into their eyes as they died and I saw who I was, and what I was capable of.

72
And what I'll be capable of.

73
Why are you telling me this tonight?

74
Did you really think this was gonna change my mind about you?

75
I just wondered if it would change your mind about yourself, and who you wanna see when you look in the mirror a year from now.

77
I know I can do this.

78
Let me tell you why.

79
Because you did.

81
You should give yourself some credit for that.

82
Now, hopefully, a year from now, I'm gonna look in the mirror and see someone like you.

84
I mean, someone capable of courage and sacrifice and love.

85
(EMMETT WHISTLES)
What is that?

86
Come on! Let's go!
I'm late for my bachelor party.

87
Send him out, Bella, or we're coming in after him.

88
So, this party.

89
Will there be strippers?

91
No, just a couple of mountain lions. Maybe a few bears.

92
Don't worry, Bella, we'll give him back in plenty of time.

93
Okay, go, before they break my house.

94
Let's go! Let's go!

95
I'll meet you at the altar.

96
I'll be the one in white.

97
That was very convincing.

99
What did I say about beauty sleep?

100
Sorry, bad dream.

101
It was wedding jitters.

102
Do you need some help?

103
I could do her hair.

104
Really?

105
Please. I'm not offended by your choice of groom.

106
Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.

107
Essentially.

108
Weddings. They bring everyone together.

109
Hey, so, did you find our daughter?

110
Are those graduation caps?

111
(LAUGHS) How creative!

112
Or weird.

113
Alice? Bella?

114
In here, Mom.

115
(GASPS) Oh, my gosh!

116
You're so beautiful.

117
Oh, honey.

118
Crap! My mascara.

119
Mom!

120
Thanks.

121
Charlie, get in here.

122
You sure? I don't wanna...

123
I know. I look hot.

125
We thought you needed something blue.

126
And something old.

127
Besides your mother.
(SCOFFS) Nice.

128
It was Grandma Swan's.

129
But we added the sapphires.

130
It's beautiful, you guys.

131
Wow. Thank you so much.

132
It's your first family heirloom.

133
Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.

134
Mom, I love it.

135
Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.

136
She's right.

137
Thank you.

138
Okay.

139
Time for the dress!

141
Do you wanna see it?
I want to see it!

143
They have got to be related.

144
What a gene pool.

145
Seriously.

146
You've got some...
The drool.

147
So, you think
Bella's gonna be showing?

148
Jess, she is not pregnant.

149
Okay. Who else gets married at 18?

152
You ready?

153
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

154
Just don't let me fall, Dad.

155
Never.

156
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here on this glorious day to witness the union of
Edward Cullen and Bella Swan.

158
Please repeat after me.

159
I, Edward Cullen.

160
I, Edward Cullen.

161
- Take you, Bella Swan.
- Take you, Bella Swan.

162
To have and to hold.

164
To have and to hold.

165
For better or for worse.

166
For richer, for poorer.

167
In sickness and in health.

168
To love.

169
To cherish.

170
As long as we both shall live.

171
I do.

172
I do.

173
I love you.

174
I love you.

177
Just thought it'd be bigger.

178
Yeah.

179
Hi!
Hi, guys.

180
We were just saying how pretty everything is, you know, just saying.

181
Well, thanks so much.
You don't think it's too much?

182
No.
Not at all.

183
No.
No.

184
Hey, man. Nice to see you.

185
I'm happy for you.
Thank you.

186
I hope you'll be happy, Bella.

187
Thank you, Billy.

188
Have you heard from him?

189
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.

190
Well, I plan on getting drunk.

191
They're serving up some pretty fancy champagne.

192
Sue, can I get you a glass?

193
Sparkling fire water.

194
Sounds great.

195
Bella.

196
Congratulations, Edward.
Thank you.

197
Bella.

198
Eleazar and Carmen, right?

199
Mmm-hmm.
Hola.

200
Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska.

201
Tanya, Kate. We've heard so much about you.

202
Welcome to the family.
Bienvenida.

203
Thank you.

204
Irina.

205
Come meet Bella.

206
I can't do this.
You promised.

207
They invited one.

208
Irina, he's our friend.

209
They killed Laurent.

210
He tried to kill Bella.

211
I don't believe that.

212
He wanted to be like us.

213
To live in peace with humans.

214
With me.

215
I'm sorry.

216
Irina!
Well.

217
Let's not monopolize the bride. Congratulations.

218
Thank you.

219
Sorry.

220
Well, what's a wedding without some family drama?

221
Yeah.
Excuse me.

222
Is this on?

223
Hello?

224
(MAN WOLF-WHISTLES)

225
Umm...

226
I'd like to propose a toast.

227
To my new sister.

228
Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep these last 18 years.

229
'Cause you won't be getting any more for a while (CHUCKLES)

231
Well, Bella was just like everybody else, totally mesmerized by Edward.

232
Or "The Hair," as I call him.

233
And then, suddenly, Edward is all about Bella.

235
Even though she's not the captain of the volleyball team.

236
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

237
Or the president of the student council.

238
Edward will be a good husband.

239
I know this because I'm a cop.

240
I know things.

241
Like how to hunt somebody to the ends of the Earth.

243
Now that you're my sister, you'll have to get over your aversion to fashion.

245
And I know how to use a gun.

246
Skirts, heels, handbags.

248
I'd like to thank
Renee and Charlie for bringing such a wonderful person into the world and into our lives.

250
We will cherish and protect her forever.

251
It's an extraordinary thing to meet someone who you can bare your soul to.

253
And who will accept you for what you are.

255
I've been waiting, what seems like a very long time, to get beyond what I am.

257
And with Bella, I feel like I can finally begin.

259
So I'd like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride.

260
No measure of time with you will be long enough.

261
But let's start with forever.

263
Whoa!

264
Whoa!

265
Another one of your gifts just arrived.

266
What?

267
Yeah, come on.

268
What's a wedding present doing out here?

269
Just a little more private.

270
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.

271
Jacob!

272
Jacob.

273
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Hey.

274
Hey, Bella.
Hey.

275
This is kind of you.

276
Kind is my middle name.

277
I'll see if
Rosalie wants to dance.

278
I'm sorry I'm late.

279
Doesn't matter.

280
Everything's perfect now.

281
Will you dance with me?

283
Where have you been?

284
We were gonna put your face on a milk carton.

285
Mostly northern Canada.

286
I think.

287
It's weird to be back on two legs again, in clothes.

288
Gotten out of practice with the whole human thing.

289
Are you okay?

290
Being here?

291
Why? Afraid I'll trash your party?

293
You're not the only one.

294
You'd think I'd be used to telling you goodbye by now.

295
Come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.

296
Everyone cries at weddings.

297
This is how I'm gonna remember you.

298
Pink cheeks.

299
Two left feet.

300
Heartbeat.

301
'Cause what, soon I'm gonna be dead to you?

302
No.

303
I'm sorry.

304
I'm just trying to appreciate your last night as a human.

305
Well, it's not my last night.

306
I thought you...

307
I didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.

308
What's the point?

309
It's not like you're gonna have a real honeymoon with him, anyway.

310
It's gonna be as real as anyone else's.

311
That's a sick joke.

312
You are joking?

313
What? While you're still human?

314
You can't be serious, Bella.
Tell me you're not that stupid.

315
I mean, it's really none of your business.

316
No! You can't do this!
Jake.

317
Listen to me, Bella.
Jake, let me go!

318
Jacob, calm down, all right?

319
Are you out of your mind? Huh?
You'll kill her!

320
Walk away, Jake.

321
Enough, Jacob!

322
Stay out of this, Sam.

323
You're not gonna start something that we'll have to finish.

324
She'll die.

325
She's not our concern anymore.

326
Let's go, Seth!

327
I'm really, really, really stupid.

328
No, it's all right.

329
Come on, people are probably missing us. Let's go back.

331
So, he really won't tell you where he's taking you?

332
No, it's a surprise.

334
Well, wear a hat.

335
Sunscreen.

336
Take care of yourself.

337
I will.

338
Okay.

339
I love you, Bella.

340
I love you.

341
So much.

342
Thank you.

343
Everything's packed and ready to go.

344
Cool.

345
Oh.

346
I'm gonna go see him.
Yeah.

347
Dad.

349
Well...

350
It's gonna be strange, you not living under my roof.

352
Yeah.

353
It's gonna be strange for me, too.

354
You know it will always be your home, right?

355
I love you, Dad. Forever.

356
I love you, too, Bells.

357
I always have and I always will.

358
All right.

359
Go on.

360
You don't wanna miss your plane.

361
Wherever it's going.

363
Okay.

364
Bye.

365
You ready?

367
Yeah, I'm ready.

373
So, we're not staying in Rio?

374
No, we're just passing through.

375
Are we close?

376
That's Isle Esme.

377
It was a gift from Carlisle.

379
Is this totally necessary?

380
I am nothing if not traditional.

381
You wanna take a look around?

382
You tired?

384
Do you wanna go for a swim?

385
Yeah, that sounds nice.

386
I could use a few human minutes.

387
Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.

388
(SIGHING) Okay.

391
Okay.

393
Alice!

395
Don't be a coward. (SCOFFS)

397
You're so beautiful.

398
I promised that we'd try.

399
If this doesn't work...

400
I trust you.

404
It's okay.

406
How badly are you hurt?

407
What?

408
No, Bella, look.

409
Bella, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

410
I'm not.

411
Really, I'm not.
I'm fine.

412
Don't say you're fine.

413
Just don't.

414
No, you don't.

415
Don't ruin this.

416
I've already ruined it.

417
Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?

418
Or was five seconds ago.

419
I mean, now I'm sort of pissed off, actually.

420
You should be angry with me.

421
I mean, we knew this was gonna be tricky, right?

422
I think we did amazing.

423
I mean, it was amazing for me.

424
That's what you're worried about?

425
That I didn't enjoy myself?

426
I know it's not the same for you, but for a human, I can't imagine that it gets any better than that.

429
Last night was the best night of my existence.

431
You're the best.

432
You're not gonna touch me again, are you?

433
You know that's not what I mean.

434
Let me make you breakfast.

439
I win.

441
Bella?

442
You having a nightmare?

443
No.

445
It was just a dream.

446
It was a really good dream.

447
Then why are you crying?

448
Because I wanted it to be real.

449
Tell me.

450
Bella, I can't.

451
Please.

452
Please.

453
Maybe they'll say she was in a car crash.

454
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.

455
Keep it in play!
Keep it in play!

456
Come on!

458
Come on! Come on!

459
At least I'll get one thing out of it.

460
No, you won't.

461
Cullens are not a danger to the town or the tribe.

462
Well, he's either gonna kill her or change her.

463
And the treaty says...
I say, Jacob.

464
I say.

465
You know, if you wanted things different, you should've become alpha.

466
Turning it down seemed like a good idea at the time.

467
Jake, you really think you could kill
Bella if she comes back a vampire?

468
No, make one of us do it, then hold a grudge against us.

469
Shut up, Leah.

470
Would you just get over it? It's not like you've imprinted on her.

471
At least they seem happy.

472
Yeah, some people are just lucky, I guess.

473
Lucky?

474
None of them belong to themselves anymore.

475
And the sickest part is their genes tell them they're happy about it.

476
Least if you imprinted on someone, you'd finally forget about Bella.

478
I mean, being any kind of happy is better than being miserable about someone you can't have.

480
Pillows survived.

481
Practice makes perfect, right?

482
I told you that.

483
That smells amazing.

484
(CHUCKLES)
I'm starving.

485
You realize how many eggs you've gone through since you've been here?

486
This island must have messed with my appetite or something.

487
I'm gonna get fat here.
(LAUGHS)

488
Eat as many eggs as you like. Pretty soon you won't want them anymore.

489
Or cheeseburgers. Or chocolate. Or ice cream.

490
Well, maybe it doesn't have to be so soon.

492
Will you wait?

493
Look, I can't understand you at all.

494
Look, I did not know how good being human could be.

497
So sex was the key after all.

498
If I'd have known that, I could have saved myself a lot of arguments.

500
Yeah, you probably could have.

501
Just hold that thought.

503
Bella, these are our housekeepers, Gustavo and Kaure.

505
Well, I guess we just leave them to it.

506
What was that all about?

507
She's afraid for you.

508
Why?

509
Because I have you here all alone.

510
You mean she knows about you?

511
She suspects.

512
She's native Ticuna. They have legends about blood-drinking demons who prey on beautiful women.

515
Hey.

517
You're late.

519
Bella?

520
Hey, don't come in here.

521
You don't need to see this.

522
"In sickness and health,"
remember?

523
It must have been the chicken.

524
Could you grab my bag?

525
What is it?

526
How many days has it been since the wedding?

527
Fourteen. Why?

528
Will you tell me what's going on?

529
I'm late.

530
My period, it's late.

531
That's impossible.

532
Can this happen?

533
Whoa!

535
Alice.
Bella?

536
Are you all right?

537
I'm not 100% sure.

538
Why? What's wrong? I just...

539
You just what?

540
Alice, what did you see?

541
Here's Carlisle.

542
Bella, what's going on?

543
I don't know. I'm a little worried.
Can vampires go into shock?

544
Has Edward been harmed?

545
No.

546
I know that it's impossible, but I think that I'm pregnant.

547
Whoa!

548
Carlisle, I swear, something just moved inside me.

549
Is this even possible?

550
I don't know.

551
What's he saying?

552
The sooner Bella's here, the sooner we can find out what it is.

553
I need you to get to the mainland at once.

554
Yeah, yeah, I will.

555
Well?

556
Damn it.

558
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.

562
What?

563
Her people have legends.
She might have seen this before.

565
I'm not gonna let it hurt you.

566
Carlisle will get that thing out.

567
Thing?

568
Wait here while we load.

569
Hello?

570
Rosalie.

571
Bella?

572
What's going on?

573
I need your help.

574
Hey, Son.

575
What's going on?

576
Bella called him.

577
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.

578
You okay?

579
So, you finally heard from Bella?

580
They're extending their trip.

581
Seems she caught a bug.

582
They wanna wait until she feels better before they travel.

583
She's sick.

584
Yeah, she told me not to worry, but she sounded, I don't know, off.

586
She'll be okay, Charlie.

587
Come on. Let's eat.

588
Jacob, let it go.

589
Is it true?

590
Hello, Jacob, how are you?

591
Listen, just give it to me straight.

592
Jake, is that you?

593
She's here? They came home two weeks ago.

594
Jake.

595
I'm glad you came.

596
Close enough.
What's your problem?

597
Rose, it's okay.

599
You look terrible.

600
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.

601
So, are you gonna tell me what's wrong with you?

602
Rose, you wanna help me up?

603
You did this!

604
We didn't know it was even possible.

605
What is it?
I'm not sure.

606
Ultrasounds and needles won't penetrate the embryonic sac.

607
I can't see it, either.

608
And I can't see
Bella's future anymore.

609
We've been researching legends, but there isn't much to go on.

610
What we do know is that it's strong.

611
And fast-growing.

612
Why haven't you done anything? Take it out of her!

613
This is none of your business, dog.

614
Rose!

615
All this fighting isn't good for Bella.

616
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

617
Say the word, Alice. "Baby."
It's just a little baby.

618
Carlisle, you've gotta do something.

619
No.

620
It's not his decision.
It's not any of yours.

621
Jacob, I need to talk to you.

622
I always knew you'd destroy her.

623
She thinks Carlisle can turn her at the last minute, like he did for me and Esme.

625
Can he?
Probability is slight.

626
And if her heart fails...

627
Look, Jacob, I need you to do something for me.

629
For her.

630
You have a connection with her that I'll never understand.

631
Maybe you could talk to her, change her mind.

632
You can keep her alive.

633
And if I can't?

634
If she dies, you get what you always wanted.

636
To kill me.

637
Rose, I'm fine, really.

638
So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me? Sort of.

639
Though I can't figure out why he thinks you'd listen to me.

640
I mean, you never have before.

642
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?

643
Rose understands what I want.

644
What are you thinking, Bella?

645
Seriously.

646
I know this seems like a scary thing, but it's not.

648
It's like this miracle or something.

649
I can feel him.

651
So, it's a bouncing baby boy.

652
I'm sorry I didn't know. Should've brought some blue balloons.

653
It's just a guess.

654
When I picture him, I see a boy.

655
We'll see.

656
You won't.

657
Jake, I can do this.

658
I'm strong enough.

659
Come on.

660
You can spout that crap to your bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.

661
I can see what that thing's doing to you. It's a killer, Bella.

662
You're wrong.

663
And when you die, what was the point? Of me loving you, you loving him.

665
How is that right for anyone?

666
Because I sure don't see it.

667
Listen to me, Bella.

668
Please.

669
Just don't do this.

670
Live, okay?

671
Please.

672
Jake, everything's gonna be okay.

673
Jacob, don't go.

674
I know how this ends.

675
And I'm not sticking around to watch.

678
Jacob. Jake, I can do this. I can do this.

679
Don't do this.

680
I'm strong enough.
I'm strong enough.

681
This is none of your business, dog.

682
Jacob, don't go.

683
You did this!

684
Everything's gonna be okay.

685
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

686
I know how this ends.

687
Don't you even care that it's killing you?

692
Jake! Jake! Jake!

693
Jake! Jake! Jake!

694
Is it true, Jacob?
What will it be?

695
It's growing fast.

696
It's unnatural.
Dangerous.

697
Monstrosity.
An abomination.

698
On our land.

699
We can't allow it.
We can't allow it.

700
We can't allow it.

701
We can't allow it.

702
We have to protect the tribe.

703
What they've bred won't be able to control its thirst.

704
Every human will be in danger.

705
We're ready.
No time to waste.

706
Now?

707
We must destroy it before it's born.

708
You mean, kill Bella?

709
Her choice affects us all.

710
Bella's human.
Our protection applies to her.

711
She's dying anyway!

713
We have real enemies to fight tonight.

714
Tonight?

715
You will fight with us, Jake.

719
(STRAINING) I will not.

720
I am the grandson of Ephraim Black.

721
I am the grandson of a chief!

722
I wasn't born to follow you, or anyone else.

725
Whoa.

726
Don't worry.
They're not following us.

727
What do you think you're doing here?

728
I left Sam's pack.
Go home, Seth.

729
I won't stand behind him.

730
Oh, yes, you will.

731
I'm not kidding.
Get out of here.

732
Is that an order?
Gonna make me bow down, too?

733
I'm not ordering anyone.

734
Look, I'm just going off on my own here, okay?

735
Great, and I've got your back.

736
No, you don't.

737
If Sam comes after Bella, are you really ready to fight your own brothers?

739
Your sister?

740
If it's the right thing to do.

741
Whatever.

742
I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads-up.

743
Do what you want.

744
How cool is this? Two-man pack. Two against the world.

745
You're getting on my nerves, Seth.

746
I'll shut up. Can do.

747
Get ready.

748
They're coming for Bella.

749
They're not gonna touch her.

750
Agreed.

751
Man, I can smell them from all the way out here.

752
What the hell are you doing here?

753
I'm not gonna let my little brother get himself killed.

754
Go away, Leah!
I can take care of myself.

755
That you think so proves you need a babysitter.

756
Okay, would the both of you shut up?

757
Did Sam send you?

758
Sam doesn't even know I left.

760
I think he just figured it out.

761
Jake.

762
I know what his plan is.

763
Sam's lost the element of surprise, and he doesn't want to take you on outnumbered, so he's not gonna come at you head on.

766
He's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for his opportunity.

767
We won't get through without a fight.

768
No fights.

769
We won't be the ones to break the treaty.

770
The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.

771
Not in ours.

772
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.

773
We'll make do.

774
You've done us a great service, Jacob.

775
Thank you.

779
I know they're out there somewhere, but I can't hear them anymore.

780
It's so quiet.

781
I stopped hearing them, too, the second I decided to leave.

782
It's nice.

783
You know you can't stay here.

784
But I don't have any place... I can't trust you with the Cullens.

785
You hate them too much.

786
You don't even like me.

787
I don't have to.

788
I just have to follow you.

789
Look, Seth doesn't want you here. Neither do I.

790
Being unwanted isn't exactly a new thing for me.

791
Look, I'll stay out of your way.

792
I'll do whatever you want, except go back to Sam's pack and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.

795
You don't know how many times I wished I could imprint on someone.

796
Anyone.

797
Just to break the connection.

799
All right.

800
I'm gonna do a perimeter run.
You got my flank?

801
Rosalie, why don't you get
Jacob something from the kitchen?

802
Thanks, but no thanks.

803
I'd rather not eat something with blondie's spit in it.

804
She would never embarrass me with such a lack of hospitality.

805
Hmm.

806
Of course not.

807
You'd tell me if she poisoned it, right?

808
He broke another one of her ribs.

810
Enjoy it, mongrel.

811
And don't make such a big deal out of it.

812
Even normal human babies have been known to crack ribs.

814
You got food in my hair.

816
(BABIES CRYING)
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

817
Your rib is cracked.

818
But there are no splinters.
You haven't punctured anything.

819
Yet.

820
Edward.

821
It's breaking her bones now.

822
It's crushing you from the inside out.

823
Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.

824
Carlisle, tell me.
It's all right.

825
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.

826
It's too strong.

827
It won't allow you to get the nutrition you need.

828
It's starving you by the hour.

829
I can't stop it, and I can't slow it down.

830
At this rate, your heart will give out before you can deliver.

831
Then I'll hold on as long as I can, and then...

832
Bella.

833
There are some conditions that even venom can't overcome.

834
You understand?

835
I'm sorry.

836
Edward, I'm sorry.

837
I can't live without you.

838
You won't. You're gonna have a part of me.

839
He'll need you.

840
Do you honestly think that I could love it or even tolerate it if it killed you?

842
It's not his fault.

843
You have to accept what is.

844
Because you've given me no choice!

845
Bella, we're supposed to be partners, remember?

846
But you decided this on your own.

847
You've decided to leave me.

848
Don't see it that way.

849
Well, I have no other way to see it.

850
'Cause it's me who'll lose you.

851
And I don't choose that.

852
I don't choose that.

855
Washington driving in the red zone.

856
Almost stripped of the ball.
He stood up and Calvin finally...

857
Are you cold?

858
I got it.

859
Don't do that.

860
What?

861
Smile like I'm your favorite person in the world.

862
You're one of them.

863
Feels complete when you're here, Jake.

866
We need to find a way to get some food into her system.

867
If I could only see the fetus... The baby.

868
...maybe I could figure out what it wants.

869
Think you might be right.

870
Jacob just had an idea.

871
It wasn't an idea.
It was a snide comment.

872
What were you thinking?

873
That it's probably just looking for someone to sink its teeth into.

874
He's thirsty.

875
I know the feeling.

876
If it's craving, it's not gonna want animal blood.

877
I have some O negative laid aside for Bella.

878
Walk with me.

879
Wait, wait, wait.

880
You're gonna make her drink that?

881
It's the fastest way to test the theory.

882
Only if you're comfortable with it.

883
I'll try anything.

884
Just hold on.

885
I think I'm gonna be sick.

886
This might make it a little easier to take.

887
Tastes good.

889
Mmm.

890
Your pulse is already getting stronger.

891
It's working.

893
Chatty, aren't they?

894
Just trying to keep us on edge.

895
It's working.

896
What?

897
I can't just stand next to you?

898
Okay.

899
See, when I'm close to you, it's like being able to shut my eyes.

900
Everything goes away.

901
Except for the wet dog smell.

902
Well, I'm glad
I can help someone.

903
Well, you sound better.

904
I am.

905
I feel much better.

906
This whole thing must've put a kink in the honeymoon, huh?

907
You could say that.

908
Otherwise, married life treating you okay?

909
Edward still walks on water and all that?

910
Yeah, but, I mean, it is different now.

911
The important thing is that you're better.

912
And that you're coming home soon, right?

913
Okay, Dad, I don't want you to freak out, but I'm going to a medical center in Switzerland.

915
What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.

916
What are you...
You said you were better.

917
I am.

918
No, Bella.
I'm getting on a plane. No.

919
No.

920
It's really more of a spa.

921
And I'm sure that I'd be better by the time you got there anyway.

922
Bells... I don't know.

923
Dad, don't come.

924
And picture me healthy, like I'm sitting on the couch with you, eating pizza or something.

926
You want me to visualize?

927
They say that it helps.

928
Just picture me like that.

929
Like I was.

930
It'll make me feel better.

931
Dad, I got to go, okay?

932
Bella.

933
I love you.

934
Bella...

936
I'm sorry I've been so angry.

938
I would be, too.

939
I've left you alone in this.

940
Marriage.

941
Well, they say the first year is the hardest.

942
Who was that?

943
What?

944
I thought I just heard...

945
Just say something else.

946
Like what?

948
Edward, what's going on?

949
He likes the sound of your voice.

950
You can hear him?

951
In mind.

952
He likes my voice as well.

953
What?

954
What do you hear?

955
It's so strange.

956
I thought he was like me, but he's not. He's like you.

957
Good and pure.

958
He's happy.

959
Of course you are.

960
Of course you're happy.
How could you not be?

961
I love you so much.

962
What do you hear now?

963
He loves you, Bella.

964
Oh, my gosh.

966
Jacob.

967
So, that's the last of it?

968
Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow.

969
If she's going to have any chance at all, she'll need more blood.

970
And you need to feed.

971
You have to be at your strongest for her. We need to go tonight.

972
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.

973
Sam won't hesitate.
You will be slaughtered.

974
Emmett will come with us.

975
That won't be enough.

976
We have no choice, Jacob.

977
If there's anything we can do to save her, we have to try.

978
You'd risk your lives for her?

979
Of course we would.

980
Bella's a part of our family now.

981
Yeah.

982
I can see that.

983
This really is a family.

984
As strong as the one I was born into.

985
I know what I have to do.

986
Jake! They're coming.

987
I know.

988
We should phase, Jacob. We can't protect ourselves like this.

989
They'll see it as a threat.

990
I wanna talk!

991
Be easier if I could hear you, too.

993
This isn't your territory anymore.

994
How's the new family working out?

995
You done?

996
You coming home, Jake?

997
Not until I finish this.

998
What do you mean?

999
I want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.

1000
What?
No way!

1001
Quiet!

1002
I want them safe.

1003
And I want this over.

1005
I need Sam to wait until Bella's been separated from the problem.

1006
You mean till she's dead.

1007
Ease up, Paul.

1008
Then what?

1009
Tell Sam that when the moment comes, I'll be the one to destroy it.

1010
Jake!

1011
I'm the only one who can.

1012
They trust me.

1018
(EMMETT GRUNTS)
(DOG WHIMPERS)

1020
You played us?

1021
Can't we come up with something just a little more classic?

1022
Thank you.

1023
They make it out all right?
Yeah.

1024
Good.

1025
Hey.

1026
Are you okay?

1027
Yeah, it's not like I'm the one carrying a demon.

1028
This is pretty important, Bella.

1029
Why don't you tell Jacob what you've decided?

1030
What now?

1031
Rose is trying to talk Bella out of her baby names.

1032
She hates them.

1033
Well, then I'm on your side no matter what you picked.

1034
They're not that bad.

1035
If it's a boy, EJ.

1036
Edward Jacob.

1037
Okay, fine, that one's not awful.

1038
Why don't you tell him the girl's name?

1039
I was playing around with our moms' names.

1040
Renee and Esme.

1041
And I was thinking...

1042
Renesmee.

1043
Renesmee.

1045
Too weird?

1046
No, that's not too weird.

1047
It's beautiful.

1048
And it's unique, which certainly fits the situation.

1049
I like Renesmee.

1050
He likes it.

1052
Rosalie, pass the morphine.

1054
Carlisle said the placenta must have detached.

1056
He's coming as fast as he can, but... We'll have to do it.

1057
Rose! Let the morphine spread.

1058
There's no time. He's dying.

1059
Get him out now!

1060
Look at me, Bella.

1062
Rosalie, don't!

1064
Alice, get her out of here!

1065
(EXCLAIMS) Rosalie!

1066
Ow! (SCREAMS)

1067
Save her!
You've got to change her!

1068
I can't, not whilst he's still in there.

1069
I got to get him out first.

1070
Stay, Bella. Stay focused.
Keep your heart beating.

1071
No! He's suffocating!

1073
Okay.

1076
Hey.

1077
Hey, hey.

1078
It's Renesmee.

1080
You're beautiful.

1083
Hey.

1084
Bella?

1085
Bella?

1086
Bella!

1087
Jacob, take the baby.

1088
Keep that away from me!

1089
Edward.

1090
I'll take her.

1091
I promise I'm okay. Let me.

1092
What is that?

1093
It's my venom.

1094
(WHISPERING) You're okay.

1095
Come on.

1096
It's supposed to be working.

1097
Oh, my God.

1098
Come on.

1099
Bella, come on.

1100
I won't kill you.

1101
That'd be too easy.

1102
You deserve to live with this.

1104
She didn't make it.

1105
You're not dead.
You're not dead.

1106
Come on!

1107
Come on!

1108
No, it will work.
It will work.

1109
Please, please, please, please.

1111
Come back to me, please, baby.

1112
Bella, Bella, please, please.

1114
Hi, hi.

1115
I don't care what he's done.

1116
He's still my son.

1117
I'm sorry, Billy.

1118
I just thought you should know.

1119
Bella's dead.

1120
It killed her.

1121
Let's go!

1123
It's like gravity.

1124
Your whole center shifts.

1125
Suddenly, it's not the Earth holding you here.

1126
You would do anything, be anything she needs.

1127
A friend, a brother.

1128
A protector.

1130
Alice! Jasper!

1131
You're gonna be all right.

1132
Stay with Bella.

1133
Do it for him.

1134
Protect him.

1135
We're outnumbered.
By a lot.

1136
I won't let them hurt my family.

1143
Stop! It's over!

1144
If you kill her, you kill me.

1145
Jacob imprinted.

1146
They can't hurt her.

1147
Whoever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed.

1148
It's their most absolute law.

1149
She shouldn't be this still.

1150
It's the morphine.

1151
Maybe I was too late.

1152
No, Edward.

1153
Listen to her heart.

1162
Ah. It's from Carlisle.

1163
Which is spelt with an "S,"
Sweet Bianca.

1164
He's added a new member to his coven.

1165
Ah.

1166
Increasing his power.

1168
First it's the spelling, then the grammar.

1170
At least our dispute with the Cullens is over.

1171
Over?
Mmm.

1172
Goodness, no.

1173
Our dispute goes far beyond the fate of a mere human.

1174
And what might it be?

1175
Why, brother, I thought you understood.

1176
They have something I want.
