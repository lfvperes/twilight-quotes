6
Who's there?

7
Who's there?

9
Help!

11
What do you want?

14
"Some say the world will end in fire"

15
"Some say in ice"

16
"From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire"

17
"But if I had to perish twice"

18
"I think I know enough of hate"

19
"To say that for destruction ice"

20
"Is also great"

21
"And would suffice"

22
You know, I've got an English final.

23
I gotta focus.

24
Marry me.

25
No.

26
Marry me.

27
Change me.

28
Okay, I will if you marry me.

29
It's called a compromise.

30
Let's just call it coercion.

31
It's not fair.

32
Marriage is just...

33
It's a piece of paper.

34
Where I'm from, it's the way one says, "I love you."

35
Well, where I come from, at my age, it's the way one says, "I just got knocked up."

37
So, you're worried about what people will think?

38
You know, two out of three marriages end in divorce.

39
Well, I think you'll find the vampirel human divorce rate is a little lower.

41
So marry me.

42
I can't.

43
I have to be back at 4:00.

45
4:00 on the dot.

46
That kid trying to brown-nose me now or something?

47
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?

48
Okay.

49
You understand why you're being punished, right?

50
I know, I put you through hell.

51
Yes, you did.

52
But I have other reasons for grounding you.

53
Like...

54
I just want you to get some separation from him.

55
Dad, there's nothing you can say.

56
Edward is in my life.

57
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

58
So, all right, how about this?

59
I'll make you a deal.

60
You're not grounded anymore if you use your new-found freedom to see some of your other friends, too, like...

62
Like Jacob.

63
He's going through a really tough time right now.

64
His dad's really worried about him.

65
I remember when that was you.

66
You needed a friend.

67
Jake was there.

68
(ON VOICE MAIL)
Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.

70
Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.

71
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.

81
You scared me.

82
You're going down to the reservation.

83
How did you...

84
Alice.

85
Hey, did you do this to my truck?

86
Bella, you have to understand.

87
Your safety is everything to me.

88
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.

89
Not intentionally, but the wolves have no control.

90
Edward.

91
I have until graduation to see him.

92
And then I'll be one of you, and he'll hate me forever.

94
Well, I'm sorry.

96
No way. Stop.
Throw it away.

97
Good.
Hey.

98
Just in time. All right, check it out.
All right. Let's see, we got.

99
"My fellow students." Right?
Good.

100
Cute.
Right? "We are the future."

101
"Anything is possible, if you just believe."

102
Nice.

103
Perfect.

104
And you got yourself a speech.

105
No, this'll be my speech when I want everyone to throw diplomas at my head.

106
So, thank you.

107
You gotta embrace the cliches, Jess.

108
They are the bread and butter of all valedictorians.

109
And that is why you are not valedictorian.

110
Jess doesn't need cliches.

111
The speech is gonna be epic.

112
Epic? It'll change lives.

113
I've decided to throw a party.

114
After all, how many times are we gonna graduate high school?

115
A party? At your place?

116
I've never seen your house.

117
No one's ever seen their house.

118
Another party, Alice?

119
It'll be fun.

120
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

121
Hey, Angela.
Yeah?

122
Do you need some help with those?
be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do, and then you'll be raking it in.

125
Wait a minute. People give you money?

127
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.

128
It was nothing.

129
You looked worried.

130
Just that everyone noticed how strange Alice is.

131
I think that ship sailed long ago.

132
I wonder what's wrong.

133
Their son went missing in Seattle over a year ago.

134
Charlie's doing what he can, but...

135
You know something about this?

136
We've been tracking the situation in Seattle for a while.

137
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.

138
If the situation gets any more conspicuous, the Volturi will step in.

139
If they go to Seattle, they could come here.

140
They could see I'm still human.

141
It won't get that far.

142
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.

143
I'll fax these down, first thing.
MR. Thank you.

144
Hey.
Hey.

145
You ready for dinner?
Yeah.

146
It is still just you and I, right?

147
No, I'm just dropping her off.

148
See you later.

149
Bye.

150
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you about the airline ticket you got for your birthday.
What airline ticket?

152
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.

153
That was generous.

154
It expires soon, so you might want to use it this weekend.

155
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.

156
It might be your last chance to see her before you graduate.

157
Might not be a bad idea.

158
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.

159
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.

160
As long as you use the companion ticket.

161
Wait. There's two tickets?

162
Super.

163
That makes me really happy.

164
I did want to see my mom.

165
I wanted to know that her life was full and satisfying.

166
Aren't you gonna miss this?

167
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

168
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

169
You know, colleges in Florida are a lot sunnier.

170
I'm just saying, if you go to the University of Alaska, I'm never gonna see you.

172
They have a really great science program.

173
You mean, Edward program?

174
The way he watches you, it's like he's willing to leap in front of you and take a bullet or something.

176
Is that a bad thing?

177
It's an intense thing.

178
You're different with him.

179
He moves, you move.

180
Like magnets.

181
I don't know, we're just...

182
In love. I get it.

183
I just want to make sure you're making the right choices for you.

184
You know, 'cause you're the one that's gonna have to live with them.

185
All right, enough with the heavy.

186
Mom.

187
Congraduation.

188
I didn't want you to spend any of your money.

189
I didn't, come on.

191
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

192
Get out!
I saved them all.

193
I thought they'd make a good quilt, keep you warm up in Alaska.

194
Remember this one? Ensenada.

195
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

196
But this one is my favorite, here.

197
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

198
This is amazing.
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

199
I just figured, you know, when you get older, have kids, we can add to it.

201
Maybe go visit the world's largest ketchup bottle or something.

202
Thanks.

203
I'm glad you like it.

204
Just thought you should have a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

205
Mom...
Yeah?

206
I miss you.

207
Honey, I miss you, too.

208
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

209
She's almost here.

210
On your left!

212
Wait!

213
She's in their territory.

214
She'll get away!

215
No, she won't!

216
Emmett, no!

219
Do you regret going?

220
No.

221
It was really great seeing my mom.

222
Just really hard saying goodbye.

223
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

224
Is that why you asked me to go?

225
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

226
I'm always hoping for that.

227
What?

228
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?

229
Of course not.

230
Hey.

231
Charlie said you left town.

232
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

233
He's checking to see if you're still human.

234
Look, I'm here to warn you.

235
If your kind come on our land again...

236
Wait, what?

237
You didn't tell her?

238
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

239
Tell me what?

240
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

241
It's nothing to worry about.

242
Listen to you.

243
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

244
You should just leave.

245
Now.

246
She has a right to know.

247
She is the one the redhead wants.

248
Victoria?

249
Alice's vision.

250
I was trying to protect you.

251
By lying to me.

252
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

253
You.

254
Why haven't you called me back?

255
I had nothing to say.

256
Well, I have tons. Hold on.
Hey.

257
Bella.

258
Edward, you have to trust me.

259
I do trust you.

260
It's him I don't trust.

261
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

262
Hold on tight.

267
Are you sure this is a good idea?

268
I am the vampire girl, remember?

269
Hey, look who's back!

270
What up, Bella?

271
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

272
Finally made the pack.

273
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

274
Maybe we can get a break from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

275
"I wish Bella would call."

276
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

277
"Maybe I should call Bella."
"Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

279
All right, you can shut up now.

280
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater, Harry's daughter.

281
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

282
If you're here to torture Jacob some more, feel free to leave.

283
Fun, isn't she?

284
Bella, hi!
Hey.

285
I was wondering when we'd see your face around here again.

286
Yeah. Same here.

287
Sam, we good?

288
We're good. She won't be getting through our line any time soon.

289
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

290
So when did Leah join the pack?

291
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

292
He's only 15, one of the youngest we've had.

293
Sam keeps him home studying, but he's chomping at the bit.

294
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

295
Come on, don't be such a guy.

296
No, it's not a chick thing.

297
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

298
We all have to live the Leah Sam Emily pain-fest.

299
Wolf telepathy, remember?

300
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

301
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

302
But Emily was the one.

303
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

304
It's more than some crush, Bella.

305
Sam imprinted on Emily.

306
Do I even want to know what that is?

307
Imprinting on someone is like...

308
Like when you see her, everything changes.

310
All of a sudden, it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

311
It's her.

312
Nothing else matters.

313
You would do anything, be anything for her.

315
Sounds like you know the feeling.

316
Have you imprinted on someone?

318
You'd know if I had.

319
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

320
So for now you're still you.

322
And you're still you.

323
Yeah.

324
Until graduation.

325
Graduation?

326
You knew this was gonna happen.

327
Not in a month!

328
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

329
Or before I could...

331
For a second, just a second, I thought...

332
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

333
I decided this, not him.

334
Bella, they're not even alive.

335
It makes me sick.

336
Better you really be dead than one of them.

337
I can't believe you said that.

338
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

339
Bella, come on. Please.

340
I'm sorry.

341
You know, Edward could at least respect meal times.

342
I was just with Jake.

343
Oh.

344
Good.

346
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

347
Hey.
Do you understand how worried I've been?

348
I was perfectly safe.

349
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

350
I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
No, something's wrong.

351
Edward, what's wrong?

352
Someone's been in here.

353
DR. Who was it?
Someone we know?

354
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

355
A nomad passing through?

356
A passerby wouldn't have left Bella's father alive.

357
The scent disappeared about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

358
Someone's orchestrating this.

359
Victoria?

360
I would have seen her decide.

361
Has to be the Volturi.

362
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

363
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

364
So we keep looking.

365
We'll also take shifts guarding Bella at her house.

366
Another protection detail?

367
DR. Rosalie.

368
No, she's right.

369
You can't protect me, watch my dad and search for the intruder.

370
And for Victoria.

371
And keep yourselves fed.

372
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

373
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

374
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

375
What?

376
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

377
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again. We'll handle it from here.

378
We don't need you to handle anything.

379
Or anyone.

380
I could care less what you need.

381
All right, we're done here.

382
No, you're done here.
Stop!

383
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

384
Edward hated the idea, but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

386
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

387
In the days that followed, I got them to at least try to work together.

388
The wolves took over so the Cullens could hunt.

389
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

391
Doesn't he own a shirt?

392
I'm good here. You should go.

393
I'm not gonna be gone long.

394
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

395
Maybe rush a little bit.

396
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

398
So, what do you wanna do today?

399
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

400
But we're going to a party tonight.

401
Are you sure this is okay?

402
I really hate being a party crasher.

403
Technically, you're a council meeting crasher.

404
You see? The council leaders, Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

405
She took over for Harry when he died.

406
Okay, I should not be here.

407
You're okay. I thought...

408
I mean, they thought it would be good for you to hear the histories.

409
The histories?

410
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

411
We all got a role to play, and you're part of this.

412
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

413
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

414
If I had known that, I would have, like...

415
I don't know, dressed better.
Jake!

416
Hey.
It's about time you got here.

417
Paul's been hoovering the grub, but I saved you some burgers.

418
Good looking out, bro.

419
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater, Leah's brother.

420
Hi.
Newest member of the pack.

421
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

422
And slowest.

423
Come on, your dad's about to start.
Okay.

424
The Quileutes have been a small tribe from the beginning, but we have always had magic in our blood.

426
We were great spirit warriors, shape-shifters that transformed to the powerful wolf.

428
This enabled us to scare off our enemies and protect our tribe.

430
One day, our warriors came across a creature.

431
It looked like a man, but it was hard like stone and cold as ice.

436
Our warriors' sharp teeth finally tore it apart, but only fire would completely destroy it.

438
They lived in fear that the cold man was not alone.

439
And they were right.

442
She took her vengeance out on the village.

443
Our elder chief, Taha Aki, was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe after his son was killed.

447
Taha Aki's third wife could see that he would lose.

448
The third wife was no magical being, with no special powers but one, courage.

452
The third wife's sacrifice distracted the cold woman long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

454
She saved the tribe.

455
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.

456
But one remains, the cold ones.

458
Our magic awakens when they're near, and we sense it now.

460
We feel the threat in our blood.

461
Something terrible is coming, and we must all be ready, all of us.

467
What did you do to me?

468
I'm so...

469
Yeah. I know.

470
We'll find you someone to drink.

471
Mine!

472
Just try not to get killed, will you?

473
I'm gonna need numbers.

474
Seattle is in a state of terror.

475
Police are baffled by the escalating murders and disappearances.

476
Theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer.

477
Reporting live...

478
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

479
It takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they're reporting.

480
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

481
It's newborns.

482
What, like new vampires?

483
In the first few months after the change.

484
That's when we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

485
Insane with thirst.

486
Something to look forward to.

487
No one's trained these newborns, but this isn't random.

488
Someone's creating an army.

489
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.

490
An army of vampires?

491
And they've been created to fight someone.

492
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

493
DR. Regardless of why they were made, if we don't put a stop to them, the Volturi will.

495
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.

496
Maybe they're behind it.

497
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

498
He wants me and Alice to join him, but he knows we'll never choose him as long as our family's still alive.

500
An army could solve that for him.

501
Hey.

502
Did you eat dinner yet?

503
No, I haven't.

505
This kid, Riley Biers, disappeared over a year ago, and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

507
You think they should just give up?

508
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

509
Not ever.

510
I have to figure out what to tell people.

511
Why I won't be home for Christmases, and why I won't visit, why they'll never see me again.

514
After a few decades, everyone you know will be dead.

515
Problem solved.

516
Why are you so against me becoming like you?

517
I've told you.

518
Be honest with me.

519
There's more.

520
I know the consequences of this choice you're making.

521
I've lived through it.

522
And to let you suffer that...

523
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

524
But to risk yours, just for the sake of never having to lose you, that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

527
I thought that you were afraid that I'd be too different.

528
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm, and I wouldn't smell the same.

529
You'll always be my Bella.

530
My Bella, just less fragile.

531
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

532
So, Alice has planned a big graduation party.

533
Which you're invited to.

534
Yeah, I figured that.

535
What?

536
I just wanted to do this differently.

537
Smoother.

538
But now I'm out of time.

539
Do what?

540
You need to hear the truth, Bella, understand all your options.

542
And you need to know that I'm in love with you, and I want you to choose me instead of him.

545
I thought you understood.

546
I don't feel that way for you.
I don't buy it.

547
What don't you buy?

548
That's how I feel.

549
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

550
So I'm not giving up.

551
I'm gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating.

553
Well, then you're not gonna have to fight for long.

554
You're rushing into it because you're afraid you'll change your mind.

555
No, I'm not.

556
I know what I want.

557
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella, or say goodbye to anybody.

559
I can give you more than him.

560
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you without hurting you.

561
Feel that?

562
Flesh and blood.

563
And warmth.

565
God!

566
God!

567
Edward!

568
If you ever touch her against her will again...

569
Don't do this here!
She's not sure what she wants.

570
Don't do this here!
Let me give you a clue.

571
Wait for her to say the words.

572
Fine! And she will.

573
Jacob, just go, okay?

574
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

575
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

576
What's going on?

577
I kissed Bella.

578
And she broke her hand.

579
Punching my face.

580
Total misunderstanding.

581
DR. It's just a sprain.

582
It should heal fairly quickly.

583
Trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again, Bella?

584
I punched a werewolf in the face.

585
Bad ass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

586
Tough enough to take you on.

587
Don't worry about it.

588
Got any leads?

589
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria continues to make appearances.

590
Go blather to someone else about the joys of becoming a newborn.

591
Okay...

592
Rosalie, I don't understand what I did to make you hate me so much.

594
Hate...

595
I don't hate you.

596
I don't particularly like you, but...

597
Bella, I envy you.

598
What?

599
That's ridiculous.
No, it's not.

600
You have a choice.

601
I didn't.

602
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

603
I don't care how miserable your human life is.

604
My life is not miserable.

605
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

606
Mine was.

607
Absolutely perfect.

608
There were things I still wanted, to be married, with a nice house and a husband to kiss me when he came home, a family of my own.

612
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor in town.

613
I barely knew him.

614
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

615
On the last night of my life, I left a friend's house late.

616
I wasn't far from home.

617
There she is.

618
Hey, Rose!

619
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

620
Hey, come over here.

621
We've been waiting for you.

622
There she is.

623
Royce. Royce!

625
You're drunk.

626
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

627
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

628
What do you say, Rose?

629
Why don't we take off a few layers?
Stop it, stop it.

630
Stop. Stop!

631
I'll see you tomorrow.

632
Sober.

633
Hey, where do you think you're going?

634
I said, get... Come back... Hey!
Stop! Stop! Get off me!

635
You'll do as I say!
Let go of me! Stop!

636
Stop! Let go! Stop!

637
They left me in the street, thinking I was dead.

638
Believe me, I wanted to be.

639
Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood.

640
Thought he was helping me.
I'm sorry.

641
I got my revenge on them.

642
One at a time.

643
Saved Royce for last, so he'd know I was coming.

646
I was a little theatrical back then.

647
Things got better after I found Emmett.

648
But we'll always be this.

649
Frozen.

650
Never moving forward.

651
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.

652
Sitting on a front porch somewhere, Emmett, gray-haired, by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.

655
Their laughter.

656
I understand that that's what you want.

657
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more than Edward.

659
You're wrong again.

660
After you've been changed, there's one thing you'll want more, one thing you'll kill for.

662
Blood.

664
What did I say about a low profile?

666
Something's coming.

667
Something bigger than any of us alone.

668
And if you can't control yourselves, we're all going to die.

670
What's done is done, just clean up after yourselves.

672
They've already drawn too much attention.

673
So has our inaction.

674
Others may begin to question the Volturi's effectiveness.

675
Let them.

676
Maybe we should consult with Aro.

678
Aro's decisions are being watched.

679
We must decide.

680
Then decide, sister. It's time.

681
Yes, it is.

682
Either we let them do what they were created for, or we end them.

684
Decisions, decisions.

685
When we were five, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up.

686
Our answers were things like astronaut, president, or, in my case, a princess.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

688
When we were 10, they asked again.

689
We answered rock star, cowboy or, in my case, a gold medalist.

690
But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer.

691
Well, how about this?

692
Who the hell knows?

694
Yeah!

695
This isn't the time to make hard-and-fast decisions.

696
This is the time to make mistakes.

697
Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere.

698
Fall in love a lot.

699
Major in philosophy, because there's no way to make a career out of that.

700
Change your mind, and change it again, because nothing's permanent.

701
So make as many mistakes as you can.

702
That way, someday, when they ask what we want to be, we won't have to guess.

704
We'll know.

707
You made it!

708
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

709
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

710
No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
Yeah?

711
It's like I was born to lead, right?

712
I love this song! Let's go.

714
What are you doing here?

715
You invited me, remember?

716
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

717
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know, the kiss and your hand.

719
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing, but it was really just me being an ass.

721
I'm really sorry.

722
I brought you something.

723
A graduation present. I made it myself.

724
Wow.

725
You made this?

726
It's really pretty.

727
Thanks.

728
I'll be right back.

729
Alice, what'd you see?
The decision's been made.

730
What's going on?

731
You're not going to Seattle.
No.

732
They're coming here.

733
They'll be here in four days.

734
This could turn into a bloodbath.

735
Who's behind it?

736
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

737
Maybe one.

738
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

739
He didn't start this.

740
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

741
They must be playing with the blind spots in your vision.

742
Either way, the army is coming and there aren't enough of us to protect the town.

744
Hold up. What damn army?

745
Newborns. Our kind.

746
What are they after?

747
They were passing around Bella's scent.

748
A red blouse.

749
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

750
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

751
All right. We're in.

752
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

753
I wasn't asking for permission.

754
Edward?

755
It means more protection for you.

756
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

757
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

758
DR. Jasper?

759
They'll give us the numbers.

760
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

761
We'll need to coordinate.

762
Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
We'll all need some training.

763
Fighting newborns requires knowledge that Jasper has.

764
You're welcome to join us.

765
All right. Name the time and place.

766
Jake, you don't know what you're getting yourself into.

767
Bella, this is what we do.

769
You should be happy.

770
Look at us, working together.

771
You are the one who wanted us to get along. Remember?

772
Again!

773
It's a graduation present.

775
They don't trust us enough to be in their human forms.

776
They came. That's what matters.

777
Will you translate?

778
Hey, Jake.

779
Welcome.

780
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

781
They want to know how the newborns differ from us.

782
They're a great deal stronger than us because their own human blood lingers in their tissues.

784
Our kind is never more physically powerful than in our first several months of this life.

786
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

787
A newborn army doesn't need thousands like a human army, but no human army could stand against them.

789
Now, the two most important things to remember are, first, never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

791
And second, never go for the obvious kill.

793
They'll be expecting that, and you will lose.

796
Emmett.

799
Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.

803
Never lose focus.

806
One more thing.

807
Never turn your back on your enemy.

814
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

815
Some of you could get killed because of me.

816
It's gonna be 100 times worse than this, right?

818
Done for the day.

819
Jasper?

820
Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?

821
Well, your presence alone, your scent, will distract the newborns.

822
Their hunting instinct will take over and drive them crazy.

823
Good. I'm glad.

824
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

825
I didn't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings.

826
Those bites are like mine.
Battle scars.

827
All the training the Confederate Army gave me was useless against the newborns.

829
Still, I never lost a fight.

830
This happened during the Civil War?

831
I was the youngest major in the Texas cavalry, all without having seen any real battle.

833
Until?

834
Till I met a certain immortal.

835
Maria.

836
I was riding back to Galveston after evacuating a column of women and children when I saw them.

839
I immediately offered them my aid.

840
Lovely. And an officer.

842
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

843
What's your name, soldier?
Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

844
I hope you survive.

845
You may be of great use to me.

846
Maria was creating an army?
They were very common in the South.

847
There were constant brutal battles for territory.

848
Maria won them all.

849
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

851
I was her second in command.

852
My ability to control emotions served her well.

853
I trained her newborns, an endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year.

856
It was my job to dispose of them.

857
I could feel everything they felt.

859
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

860
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

861
I didn't know there was another way till I found Alice.

863
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

864
You kept me waiting long enough.

865
My apologies, ma'am.

866
I don't know what I'd have become without her.

868
You never have to be that again.

870
Jasper.

871
I want you to do something for me.

872
Kill her.

874
What is it?

875
The intruder, the newborn army, they're all her puppets.

878
Victoria.

879
Alice would have seen if she wanted to make an army.

880
Unless she's hiding behind them and she's letting someone else decide.

881
Welcome to the army.

883
I'm not just gonna hide while you're out taking all the risks for me.

884
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible.

885
Jasper said that I could be of help.
We won't need your help.

886
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

887
The rest of us aren't gonna have enough to do.

888
Okay. Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide or it's so easy that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

890
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

891
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

892
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

893
Okay, you're right.

894
So I'm coming with you.
No, we both stay away together.

895
I can't make you choose between me and your family.

896
The only way I can protect you is to be with you.

897
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

898
He's doing it for me, okay?
Whatever.

899
Just tell me the plan.

900
This field will give us an advantage in battle.

901
We need to lure the newborns with Bella's scent, but it needs to end here.

903
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

904
Even if he carries me, they'll still pick up on our scents.

905
Your stench, however, is revolting.

906
Dude, you really don't wanna start comparing stinks.

907
What he means is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me.

908
Done.
This is not a good idea.

909
Edward, they won't want to get anywhere near his odor.

910
Okay. Let's just try it.

911
Eau de wolf coming up.
Run.

912
So you gonna ask me to sit out of the fight, too?

913
Or don't you care about my safety?

914
Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
I won't have a choice, anyways.

915
Since I let Sam be alpha male, I gotta live with the shots he calls.

916
Since you let Sam be alpha?

917
I didn't wanna be in a pack, let alone be its leader.

918
Wow.

919
Chief Jacob.
Opted out.

920
But every choice has its consequences.

921
Some more than others.
Don't start.

922
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

923
But you can love more than one person at a time.

924
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

925
Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
It has nothing to do with imprinting.

926
It has to do with feeling something for somebody.

927
And I know you feel something for me.

928
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

929
I make you nervous.

930
Jake.

931
Don't worry.

932
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again till you asked.

933
You're gonna be keeping that promise for a while, chief.

934
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

935
This will work.
Great.

937
Yes. Scout's honor.

938
Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
Okay.

939
Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.

940
Really?

941
I told your father that our whole family's going camping this weekend, so you and I are having a sleepover at my house.

943
Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
Charlie?

944
You guys are on first name basis now?
Me, he likes.

945
Actually, you and Edward will have the house to yourself tonight.

946
Like alone?

947
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

948
You're welcome.

949
Hey. You want a sandwich?
No, I'm good.

950
Well, the sister, I like.

951
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

952
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

953
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

954
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

955
Why?
I don't know.

956
I thought you just maybe gave up on the whole institution of it, of marriage.

958
But do you think there's any value in it?

959
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

960
When you're older.

961
Much older.

962
Like your mother.

963
It seemed to work out fine for her the second time around, later in life.
Yeah, I guess.

965
I mean, you definitely don't wanna have to get married because you weren't careful.

967
What?
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

968
There's things you need to think about if you're gonna be physically intimate.

969
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

970
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me as it is for you.

971
I doubt that.

972
And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

973
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

974
I'm sure things work the same way.

975
All right, so...

976
You guys are taking precautions and...

977
Okay, Dad, please, just don't worry about that.

978
Edward is old school.

979
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

980
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

981
Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

982
Virgin.

983
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

984
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

985
Nothing.

986
It seems only fair that I be represented, as well.

987
It's really pretty.

988
Thanks.

989
There's a bed.

990
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

991
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

992
Is this too much?
No.

993
No, it's perfect.

994
I wanna ask you something.
Anything.

995
Okay, marriage is the condition for you to change me yourself, right?

996
Yes.

997
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

998
Anything you want. It's yours.

999
You promise?

1000
Yeah.

1001
Okay.

1002
Hey.

1003
Bella.

1004
No.

1005
But you said that you wanted me to have every human experience.

1006
Not ones that will risk killing you.
You won't.

1007
And everyone says once I'm changed all
I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1008
That part doesn't last forever.
I want you.

1009
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1010
It's too dangerous.
Try. Just try.

1011
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive college and let you buy me a car.

1012
I'll marry you. Just try.

1020
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

1021
You wanna do that part?
Not tonight.

1022
You...

1023
You mean, you don't...

1024
(SIGHING) That's fine.

1025
Believe me, I want to.

1026
I just want to be married to you first.

1027
You really make me feel like I'm some sort of villain trying to steal your virtue or something.

1029
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1030
Are you kidding?

1031
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1032
It might be too late for my soul, but I will protect yours.

1033
I know that's not a modern notion.

1034
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1035
I'm from a different era.

1036
Things were a lot less complicated.

1037
And if I'd have met you back then, I would have courted you.

1038
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch.

1039
I may have stolen a kiss or two, but only after asking your father's permission.

1041
I would have got down on one knee, and I would have presented you with a ring.

1043
This was my mother's.

1044
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you every moment of forever.

1045
And would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1046
Yes.

1048
You're not coming with us?

1049
It'll be a last minute decision.

1050
I told you how it works.
The Cullens have powers.

1051
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers, but they'll be able to anticipate your every move.

1053
According to your friend?
Yes.

1054
My dead friend.

1055
Laurent found out about the things they could do, and they killed him.

1057
But not before he told me.

1058
Maybe he was wrong.

1059
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1060
We've been tearing it up and I've never even seen them here.

1061
You don't trust me.

1062
With my life. I'm just saying...
I'm doing this for us.

1063
So that we can feed without their retaliation.

1064
I can't live in fear anymore, waiting for them to attack.

1065
I won't let them.

1066
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1067
I swear.

1068
I love you so much.

1069
You're going overboard.

1070
If this is all I can contribute, I wanna be thorough.

1071
The new borns'll be frantic.

1072
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1073
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1074
Since when?

1075
Since I spent 24 hours thinking you were dead.

1076
You're not wearing your ring.

1077
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1078
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1079
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1080
If you're having second thoughts...
I'm not.

1081
I just want him to have a clear head.
Whose head is unclear?

1082
Nobody's I hope.

1083
Alice says there's a storm coming.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1084
We should get going.

1085
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1086
Something up?

1087
Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
Same old same old.

1088
Thank you.

1089
You should get back before the storm hits.

1090
No, I'm staying.

1091
You'll need my connection to the pack to keep tabs on what's going on.

1092
You're not gonna fight?
Seth will spell me in the morning.

1093
He's not happy about missing the action but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1094
Let's get you inside.

1096
I should have chosen a site lower down.
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1097
What can I do?

1099
I can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on.

1100
Forget it.
She may need her toes someday.

1101
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1102
Get your hand off me.
Keep your hands off her.

1103
Don't fight.

1104
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1105
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1106
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1107
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1108
Jake.
Survival 101.

1109
Can you at least attempt to control your thoughts?

1110
I really get under that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1111
What?

1112
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1113
Nice.

1114
So picking through my brain's okay, but letting me into yours, forget it.

1115
Look.

1116
I know she's in love with you.
Good.

1117
But she's in love with me, too.

1118
She just won't admit it to herself.

1119
I can't tell if you're right.

1120
Then let me ask you something.

1121
If she chooses me...
She won't.

1122
If she did, would you try to kill me?

1124
That's an intriguing idea.

1125
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1126
So you'd just turn her into a blood-sucking demon like you?

1127
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1128
So stop her.
I tried.

1129
I left.
But you gave up too quickly.

1130
If you'd stayed away another 6 months, I could've made her happy.

1131
Trust me.

1132
You have to consider that I might be better for her than you are.

1133
I have considered that.

1134
I know you can protect her.

1135
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1136
But I'm not...

1137
I'm not going to force her into anything ever again.

1138
The last time I tried, it almost killed us both.

1139
Yeah. That I remember.

1140
When you thought she was gone, that you'd lost her, how did you cope?

1143
There are no words.

1144
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1145
This might sound odd, but I'm glad you're here.

1146
Meaning, "As much as I'd love to kill you, I'm glad she's warm."

1148
If we weren't natural enemies and you weren't trying to steal my reason for existing, I might actually like you.

1151
Well, if you weren't planning on sucking the life out of the girl I love, I might...

1154
No. Not even then.

1155
But she could still change her mind, you know.

1156
Then I'd let her go.

1157
Right. Hey, Seth.

1158
Where's Jacob? Did he already...
Not yet.

1159
He's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes.

1160
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1161
It definitely won't make my list of top 10 favorite evenings.

1162
You have a list?
All 10 I spent with you.

1163
Number one is when you said you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1164
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1165
You're marrying him?
Jake, I...

1166
You knew he was listening!
He deserves to know.

1167
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1168
Don't!

1169
Jake, stop!

1170
Jake, please!
I'm done! I'm so done!

1171
What can I do?

1172
You can't do anything. I can, by going out there and killing something.

1173
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1174
Maybe I'll get myself killed and make it simple for you.

1175
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1176
Why?

1177
Give me one good reason.

1178
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1179
It's not good enough.

1180
Because you're too important.

1181
Still not good enough.
Jacob!

1182
Kiss me.

1183
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1184
That should have been our first kiss.

1185
I gotta go.

1186
I'll be back.

1187
You saw.
No, but...

1188
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1189
I don't know what happened.

1190
You love him.

1191
I love you more.

1192
I know.

1195
It's starting.

1199
Jacob just got there.

1200
He's good.

1203
Someone's hurt?

1204
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

1205
Seth, go.

1206
She knew we weren't there, but she caught my scent.

1207
She knew you'd be with me.

1208
She found us.

1209
She's not alone.

1210
Riley, listen to me.

1211
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

1212
She knows I'll kill you.

1213
In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1214
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1215
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

1216
He's lying.

1217
She only created you and this army to avenge her true mate, James.

1218
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1219
There's only you. You know that.

1220
Think about it. You're from Forks.

1221
You know the area.

1222
That's the only reason she chose you.

1223
She doesn't love you.

1224
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1225
You know I love you.

1226
You're dead.

1229
You won't get another chance like this again.

1230
You want her.

1231
You want me to feel the pain you felt when I killed James, when I tore him to pieces, when I turned him into ash, when I turned him into nothing.

1240
Victoria!

1241
Victoria!

1242
Victoria!

1245
Something is wrong.
Alice needs us to go.

1246
Now.

1247
How long?
A few minutes. Maybe 10?

1248
DR. The pack needs to leave.

1249
The Volturi won't honor a truce with the werewolves.

1251
Leah, don't!

1252
Jacob!

1253
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

1254
The bones on the right half of his body are shattered.

1255
Bella.
Jake, I'm right here.

1256
Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
Leah!

1257
I need to set the bones before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1258
It's already starting.
We need to get him out of here.

1259
We're not gonna win a fight with the Volturi.

1260
We'll take him back to Billy's.
I'll be there soon as I can.

1261
Hang in there, Jake.

1263
It's okay. We got you.
We got you.

1264
They're coming.

1265
Impressive.

1266
I've never seen a coven escape an assault of this magnitude intact.

1267
We were lucky.

1268
I doubt that.

1269
It appears we missed an entertaining fight.

1270
Yes.

1271
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1272
If you'd arrived a half hour ago, you would have fulfilled your purpose.

1273
Pity.

1274
You missed one.

1275
We offered her asylum in exchange for her surrender.

1276
That wasn't yours to offer.

1277
Why did you come?

1279
Who created you?

1281
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

1282
I know.

1283
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1284
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1285
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1286
DR. Edward, if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria, they would have stopped her.

1288
Isn't that right, Jane?

1289
Of course.

1290
Felix.

1291
She didn't know what she was doing.

1292
We'll take responsibility for her.

1293
Give her a chance.

1294
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1295
Caius will be interested to know that she's still human.

1296
The date is set.

1297
Take care of that, Felix.
I'd like to go home.

1299
Hey.
(JACOB SCREAMING)

1300
It's been going on for a while.
Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1301
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1302
Give it a rest, Leah.

1303
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1304
I gave him some morphine, but his body temperature will burn it off soon.

1306
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1307
Thank you.

1308
He's asking for you.

1309
Hey, Jake.

1310
Hey.

1311
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?

1312
Yeah.

1313
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1314
Was he hard on you?
He wasn't even mad at me.

1315
Or you.

1316
Well, damn.

1317
He's better than I thought.
He's not playing a game.

1318
Right.

1319
Bella.

1320
He's not as perfect as you think.

1321
I know who he is.

1322
Can we just not talk about that?

1323
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done at once.

1324
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1325
It wasn't easy making you admit your feelings for me.

1326
I only fought them because I knew they wouldn't change anything.

1327
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1328
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1329
You know I love you.

1330
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1331
Should I come back?

1332
I need some time.

1333
But I'll always be waiting.

1334
Until my heart stops beating.

1335
Maybe even then.

1336
August 13th?
Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1337
I don't need to be another year older than you.

1338
Alice said she could get the wedding together by then.

1339
I'm sure she can.

1340
There's no rush.

1341
I've chosen my life. I want to start living it.

1342
And so you're gonna let Alice plan the whole thing?

1343
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1344
I mean, who knows who she's gonna invite?

1345
Does it matter?

1346
I just don't know why you're doing this.

1347
What? The wedding?
No.

1348
You're trying to make everyone else happy, but you're already giving away too much.

1350
You're wrong.

1351
This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob.

1352
It was between who I should be and who I am.

1353
I've always felt out of step, like literally stumbling through my life.

1354
I've never felt normal.

1355
Because I'm not normal.

1356
I don't want to be.

1357
I've had to face death and loss and pain in your world, but I've also never felt stronger and more real, more myself.

1360
Because it's my world, too.

1361
It's where I belong.

1362
So it's not just about me?

1363
No. Sorry.

1364
I've made a mess trying to figure all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1365
And I wanna tie myself to you in every way humanly possible.

1366
Starting with a wedding.

1367
Actually, something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1369
We have to tell Charlie.

1370
It's highly dangerous.

1371
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1372
I'm gonna need that ring.
