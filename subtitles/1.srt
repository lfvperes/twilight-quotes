1
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:24,156
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

2
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:37,236
But dying in the place
of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.

3
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:13,772
So I can't bring myself
to regret the decision
to leave home.

4
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,576
I would miss Phoenix.

5
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,680
I'd miss the heat.

6
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,752
I would miss my loving,
erratic, harebrained mother.

7
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:28,820
Okay.

8
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:30,722
Renee, come on.

9
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:32,524
And her new husband.

10
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:33,725
Guys, come on.
I love you both.

11
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:35,293
We got a plane to catch.

12
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,295
But they want to
go on the road,

13
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:39,264
so I'm gonna spend
some time with my dad,

14
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:42,468
and this will be
a good thing.

15
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,237
I think.

16
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:49,474
♪ When the thorn bush
turns white

17
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:55,614

18
00:01:55,647 --> 00:02:02,321

21
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:13,765
In the state of Washington,

22
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,269
under a near constant cover
of clouds and rain,

23
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,638
there's a small town
named Forks.

24
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:23,575
Population, 3,120 people.

25
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:27,212
This is where I'm moving.

26
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,749
My dad's Charlie.

27
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,752
He's the chief of police.

28
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:38,624

31
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:50,569
I cut it since
the last time
I saw you.

32
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,207
Guess it grew out again.

33
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,219
I used to
spend two weeks here
almost every summer,

34
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,655
but it's been years.

35
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:26,871
I've cleared
some shelves off
in the bathroom.

36
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,774
Right. One bathroom.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,482
It's a pretty
good work lamp.

38
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,453
The sales lady
picked out
the bed stuff.

39
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,788
You like purple, right?

40
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,557
Purple's cool.

41
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,626
Thanks.

42
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,300
Okay.

43
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:03,541
One of the best
things about Charlie,

44
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,310
he doesn't hover.

45
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,786
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

46
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,288
Good to see you.

47
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,724
Bella, you remember
Billy Black.

48
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,326
Yeah.

49
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,493
Wow, you're looking good.

50
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,729
Well, I'm still dancing.

51
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,264
I'm glad you're finally here.

52
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,767
Charlie here hasn't shut up
about it since you told him
you were coming.

53
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,837
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

54
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,773
After I ram you
in the ankles.

55
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:34,806
You want to go?

56
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,341
Yeah.

57
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,776
Bring it.

58
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:37,809
Hi, I'm Jacob.

59
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:40,779
Hey.

60
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,682
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.

61
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,483
Right. No, I remember.

62
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:49,521
Are they always like this?

63
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:49,554
It's getting worse
with old age.

64
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:51,890
Good.

65
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:53,725
So, what do you think?

66
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,761
Of what?

67
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:57,729
Your homecoming present.

68
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,531
This?

69
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:00,865
Just bought it
off Billy here.

70
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:02,600
Yep.

71
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,768
I totally rebuilt
the engine for you.

72
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,670
Come on.

73
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:07,072
Oh, my gosh!

74
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:09,808
This is perfect.
Are you joking me?

75
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,644
Sorry.

76
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,680
I told you she'd love it.

77
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,549
I'm down with the kids.

78
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,818
Oh, yeah, dude.
You're the bomb.

79
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,120
Okay.

80
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,522
Listen,
you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

81
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,524
but besides that,
you should be good.

82
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:27,759
That's this one?

83
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:28,793
Yeah. Yeah, right there.

84
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,363
All right.

85
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,498
Do you want a ride to
school or something?

86
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,533
I go to school
on the reservation.

87
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:35,566
Right, right.

88
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,036
Yeah.

89
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,706
That's too bad.
It would've been nice
to know one person.

90
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,614
My first day
at a new school.

91
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,816
It's March,
middle of the semester.

92
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,052
Great.

93
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,060
Nice ride.

94
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:03,729
Thanks.

95
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,365
Good one.

96
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,573
You're Isabella Swan,
the new girl.

97
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:20,044
Hi, I'm Eric,
the eyes and ears
of this place.

98
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:23,648
Anything you need,
tour guide, lunch date,
shoulder to cry on?

99
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:30,789
I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

100
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,291
Good headline
for your feature.

101
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm on the paper,
and you're news,
baby, front page.

102
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,062
No, I'm not.

103
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,764
You...

104
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,566
Please don't
have any sort of...

105
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,068
Chillax. No feature.

106
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:44,101
Okay, thanks.

107
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,804
Cool?

108
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,639
All right. Okay. Yeah.

109
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,711
Get it! Get it! Get it!

110
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,714
To you!

111
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:57,782
Whoa!

112
00:06:57,815 --> 00:06:59,150
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:01,820
I told them not
to let me play.

114
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,055
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

115
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,791
You're Isabella, right?

116
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,092
Just Bella.

117
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,795
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

118
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:10,828
Nice to meet you.

119
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,064
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:14,165
She's got
a great spike, huh?

121
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:15,099
Yeah, it's...

122
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,135
I'm Jessica, by the way.

123
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,837
Hey, you're from
Arizona, right?

124
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,672
Yeah.

125
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,108
Aren't people from Arizona
supposed to be, like,
really tan?

126
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,643
Yeah.

127
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,813
Maybe that's why
they kicked me out.

128
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,784
You're good.

129
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,754
That's so funny.

130
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:39,824
Back in, Jess.

131
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,092
Down here.

132
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:43,628
Like a masterpiece,
you know,

133
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,864
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid
fall from the sky,

134
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:45,897
and then
you guys can...

135
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,866
It's my pleasure, Madame.

136
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,067
You guys can give
each other high fives.

137
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,001
Burrito, my friend?

138
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,169
Hey, Mikey! You met
my home girl, Bella?

139
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,904
Hey.

140
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:53,905
Your home girl?

141
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:53,938
Yeah.

142
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,073
Yeah?

143
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:55,106
That's...

144
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,642
My girl.

145
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:58,810
Sorry I had to mess
up your game, Mike!

146
00:07:58,843 --> 00:07:59,844
Tyler.

147
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,147
Yes!

148
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,582
Oh, my God.

149
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,084
It's like first grade
all over again.

150
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,086
You're the shiny new toy.

151
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,088
Smile.

152
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:10,788
Okay.

153
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,090
Sorry.

154
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,191
I needed a candid
for the feature.

155
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:14,926
The feature's dead,
Angela.

156
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,095
Don't bring it
up again.

157
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,196
It's okay, I just...

158
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,832
I got your back, baby.

159
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:24,102
Guess we'll just run
another editorial
on teen drinking.

160
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:27,873
You know,
you can always go
for eating disorders.

161
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,809
Speedo padding
on the swim team.

162
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:33,611
Actually, that's a good one.

163
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:33,644
Kirk. Right? That's
exactly what I thought.

164
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:36,581
Yeah.

165
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,816
We're talking Olympic-size.

166
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:39,884
There's no way.
He's so skinny.

167
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:40,919
It doesn't make sense.

168
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:40,952
Totally.

169
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,820
Yeah.

170
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:46,725
Who are they?

171
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,693
The Cullens.

172
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:53,665
They're Dr. and Mrs.
Cullen's foster kids.

173
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:57,168
They moved down here
from Alaska, like,
a few years ago.

174
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,571
They kind of
keep to themselves.

175
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,205
Yeah, 'cause
they're all together.

176
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:03,108
Like, together, together.

177
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,846
The blonde girl,
that's Rosalie,

178
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,350
and the big
dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

179
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:13,851
I'm not even sure
that's legal.

180
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,354
Jess, they're not
actually related.

181
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:19,090
Yeah, but they
live together.
It's weird.

182
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,794
And, okay, the little
dark-haired girl's Alice.

183
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,929
She's really weird,

184
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:28,700
and she's with Jasper,
the blond one who looks
like he's in pain.

185
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,809
Dr. Cullen's like this
foster dad/matchmaker.

186
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,644
Maybe he'll adopt me.

187
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,113
Who's he?

188
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,655
That's Edward Cullen.

189
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,358
He's totally gorgeous,
obviously,

190
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,695
but apparently
nobody here's
good enough for him.

191
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,764
Like I care, you know?

192
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:01,299
So, yeah.

193
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:07,205
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

194
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:09,374
I wasn't planning on it.

195
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:19,450
Mr. Molina.

196
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,386
Hey, Mike.

197
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:24,789
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

198
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:41,939
Hi. Can I have the pass?
Thank you.

199
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,442
Welcome to the class. Here.
Here's your stuff, okay?

200
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,178
And I got a seat
for you right here,
so come over.

201
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,681
The last one.
Just follow along
till you catch up.

202
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:53,785
All right, guys, today
we are gonna be observing
the behavior of planaria,

203
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,687
aka flatworms.

204
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,690
So what we're gonna do...

205
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:04,195
...regenerate.

206
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:06,398
Zombie worms.

207
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,869
No cell phones.
Guys, let's get to it.

208
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,105
Gentle, gentle,
certain areas.

209
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:17,842
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

210
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,378
You won't believe this.

211
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,748
Let's try to focus
while we check
those out, huh, guys?

212
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,127
There must be
something open.

213
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,829
Physics? Biochem?

214
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:38,863
No, every class is full.

215
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,799
Just a minute, dear.

216
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:44,736
I'm afraid you'll
have to stay in biology.

217
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:48,907
Fine. Just...
I'll just have to
endure it.

218
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,958
I just can't get over
how grown up you are.

219
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,827
And so gorgeous.

220
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,829
Hey, Bella.

221
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,164
You remember me?

222
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,135
I played Santa one year.

223
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,138
Yeah, Waylon,
she hasn't had a Christmas
here since she was four.

224
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,973
I bet I made an impression,
though, didn't I?

225
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,775
You always do.

226
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,409
Butt-crack Santa?

227
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:27,478
Hey, kids love those
little bottles, though.

228
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:30,948
All right, let the girl eat
her garden burger, Waylon.

229
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,217
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you
your favorite.

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,153
Berry cobbler, remember?

231
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,156
Your dad still has it.
Every Thursday.

232
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:39,891
Thank you.
That'd be great.

233
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:45,930
Here.

234
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:47,799
Thanks.

235
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,178
Hey, baby. So, listen,
if spring training goes well,

236
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,112
we could be moving to Florida.

237
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,080
Please insert $1.25

238
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,549
for an additional
three minutes.

239
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:05,550
Mom, where's your cell?

240
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,285
Okay, don't laugh.

241
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,587
I didn't lose
my power cord.
It ran away.

242
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:14,058
Screaming. I literally
repel technology now.

243
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:15,960
I miss you.

244
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,462
Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

245
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:19,897
But tell me more
about your school.

246
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,531
Now, what are the kids like?

247
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,934
Are there any cute guys?

248
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,569
Are they being nice to you?

249
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,071
Well,

250
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,508
they're all very welcoming.

251
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,144
Tell me all about it.

252
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,579
It doesn't even matter.

253
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,180
Yes, it does, honey.

254
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:39,083
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.

255
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,519
Okay. I love you.

256
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,154
Love you, too.

257
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,498
I planned to confront him

258
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:56,501
and demand to know
what his problem was.

259
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,278
But he never showed.

260
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,053
Bella!

261
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:32,136
And the next day,
another no-show.

262
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,510
More days passed.

263
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:42,080
Things were getting
a little strange.

264
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:31,996
You all right?

265
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,597
Yeah, I'm good.

266
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,567
Ice doesn't really help
the uncoordinated.

267
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,237
Yeah. That's why
I had some new tires
put on the truck.

268
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,174
Old ones were
getting pretty bald.

269
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,608
Well, probably
be late for dinner.

270
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,210
I gotta head down
to Mason County.

271
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,611
Security guard
at the Grisham Mill

272
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:50,181
got killed by
some kind of animal.

273
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:52,150
An animal?

274
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,587
You're not in
Phoenix anymore, Bells.

275
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,522
Anyway,
I figured I'd lend a hand.

276
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,024
Be careful.

277
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,092
Always am.

278
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,761
And thanks for the tires.

279
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:05,063
Yeah.

280
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,214
Prom Committee
is a chick thing,

281
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,216
but I gotta cover it
for the paper anyway,

282
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,784
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,

283
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:27,918
so I need your play list.

284
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:32,757
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

285
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,525
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

286
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,527
How you liking
the rain, girl?

287
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,628
Better get used
to it, girl.

288
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,263
Yeah, Mike, hey,
you're real cute, man.

289
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,999
Oh, I know...

290
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:42,700
That was really awesome.

291
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,136
Why you shooting down
my game? Let a playa play.

292
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,538
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at,
T-Ball?

293
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,617
Hello.

294
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,521
I'm sorry,
I didn't get a chance to
introduce myself last week.

295
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,523
I'm Edward Cullen.

296
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,091
You're Bella?

297
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:09,559
Yes.

298
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,295
Onion root tip cells,

299
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,330
that's what's on
your slides right now.

300
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:17,368
Okay?
So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,

301
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,170
and the first partners
that get it right

302
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,073
are gonna win
the Golden Onion.

303
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,111
All right, good.

304
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:29,514
Ladies first.

305
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,120
You were gone.

306
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,289
Yeah.

307
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:40,624
I was out of town
for a couple of days.

308
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,326
Personal reasons.

309
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,096
Prophase.

310
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,166
Do you mind if I look?

311
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,139
It's prophase.

312
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,241
Like I said.

313
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,216
So are you enjoying
the rain?

314
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,587
What?

315
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,755
You're asking me
about the weather?

316
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,124
Yeah, I...

317
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,226
I guess I am.

318
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,531
Well, I don't
really like the rain.

319
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,104
Any cold, wet thing,
I don't really...

320
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:31,809
What?

321
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,211
Nothing.

322
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,550
It's anaphase.

323
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,185
You mind if I check?

324
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:42,620
Sure.

325
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:52,196
Anaphase.

326
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,265
Like I said.

327
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:00,571
If you hate the cold
and the rain so much,

328
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:04,308
why'd you move to
the wettest place
in the continental US?

329
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,550
It's complicated.

330
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,552
I'm sure I can keep up.

331
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,225
My mom remarried, and...

332
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,329
So you don't
like the guy, or...

333
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,632
No, that's not...

334
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,536
Phil's really nice.

335
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:47,885
It's metaphase.
You want to check it?

336
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,956
I believe you.

337
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:55,193
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

338
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:00,831
Well,
Phil's a minor league
baseball player,

339
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:03,801
and he travels a lot,

340
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,303
and my mom
stayed home with me,

341
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,271
but I knew
it made her unhappy,

342
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:11,642
so I figured I'd stay
with my dad for a while.

343
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,813
And now you're unhappy.

344
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,581
No.

345
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:18,583
I'm sorry, I'm just...

346
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,786
I'm just trying
to figure you out.

347
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:25,256
You're very difficult
for me to read.

348
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,291
Hey, did you get contacts?

349
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,593
No.

350
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,263
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

351
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:36,300
and now they're,
like, golden brown.

352
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,602
Yeah, I know, it's the...

353
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:41,606
It's the fluorescents.

354
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:36,793
Bella!

355
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:38,362
Bella!

356
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:40,764
Dial 911!

357
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,700
I already called.
They're gonna send
somebody over soon.

358
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,835
Bella, I'm so sorry.
I panicked.

359
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,806
Bella, I've got 911
on the phone now.

360
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:56,814
Bella. You okay?

361
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,550
You and I are gonna talk.
You all right?

362
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,618
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

363
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,887
I'm sorry, Bella.
I tried to stop.

364
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,754
I know. It's okay.

365
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,825
No.
It sure as hell
is not okay.

366
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,859
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

367
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,395
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

368
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:13,097
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

369
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:17,368
You can kiss your
license goodbye.

370
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,535
I heard the chief's
daughter was here.

371
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:19,837
Dr. Cullen.

372
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,705
Charlie.

373
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,607
I've got this one,
Jackie.

374
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:25,810
Isabella.

375
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,145
Bella.

376
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,081
Well, Bella, looks like
you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

377
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,350
Good.

378
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:35,853
Look here.

379
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:39,790
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress
or disorientation,

380
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,759
but your vitals look good.

381
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,827
No signs of any head trauma.

382
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,662
I think you'll be just fine.

383
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,732
I'm so sorry, Bella.
I'm really...

384
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:52,536
You know,
it would've been
a whole lot worse

385
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,105
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me
out of the way.

386
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,141
Edward? Your boy?

387
00:22:57,974 --> 00:22:59,176
Yeah, it was amazing.

388
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,811
I mean,
he got to me so fast.

389
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:02,179
He was nowhere near me.

390
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:04,181
Sounds like you
were very lucky.

391
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,616
Charlie.

392
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:12,656
I gotta go sign
some paperwork.
You should...

393
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,859
You should probably
call your mom.

394
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:17,661
Did you tell her?

395
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:22,400
She's probably just

396
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,102
freaking out.

397
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:27,904
...fifteen kids that
saw what happened.

398
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:30,741
What was I
supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

399
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:33,644
This isn't just about you.
It's about all of us.

400
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:35,880
I think we should
take this in my office.

401
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:39,783
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

402
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:40,851
Rosalie.

403
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:48,726
What?

404
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,665
How did you get over
to me so fast?

405
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:57,100
I was standing right
next to you, Bella.

406
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,671
No. You were
next to your car,
across the lot.

407
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,773
No, I wasn't.

408
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:06,877
Yes, you were.

409
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:12,182
Bella, you're...
You hit your head.

410
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,951
I think you're confused.

411
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,219
I know what I saw.

412
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,721
And what exactly was that?

413
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,690
You...

414
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,094
You stopped the van.

415
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,664
You pushed it away
with your hand.

416
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:30,134
Well, nobody's
gonna believe you, so...

417
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,605
I wasn't gonna
tell anybody.

418
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,774
I just need to
know the truth.

419
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,678
Can't you just thank me
and get over it?

420
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,680
Thank you.

421
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:45,582
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

422
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:46,950
No.

423
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,787
Well, then I hope you
enjoy disappointment.

424
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:27,791
And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.

425
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,195
I need everybody's
permission slips, okay?

426
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:32,228
Sammy, please collect them.

427
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:33,964
Yeah.

428
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:35,832
Guys, let's go.

429
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,769
Come on, get in.
In. Let's go!

430
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,184
Look at you, huh?
You're alive.

431
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,819
I know, yeah.
False alarm, I guess.

432
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,754
Yeah.

433
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:01,124
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

434
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,859
it's like
a month away, but...

435
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,731
Do you wanna go
to prom with me?

436
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,803
So, what do you think?

437
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,838
About what?

438
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:15,773
Do you want to go?

439
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:19,376
To prom?

440
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,144
With me?

441
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:25,816
Prom.

442
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,918
Dancing.

443
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,788
Not such a good idea for me.

444
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:35,158
I have something
that weekend anyway.

445
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm going to Jacksonville
that weekend.

446
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:39,196
You can't go another weekend?

447
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:40,798
Non-refundable ticket.

448
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:43,967
You should ask Jessica.

449
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,969
I know she wants
to go with you.

450
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,705
All right. All right.

451
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:51,241
Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, guys, come on.

452
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:52,909
We gotta go. We gotta go.

453
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:54,778
Green is what? Good.

454
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,814
Let's go. Guys, come on.

455
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,417
Other bus, other bus.
Let's go.

456
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,551
Egg shells, carrot tops.

457
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,788
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that
in there, Eric.

458
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:04,821
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

459
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,989
Very good, very good.

460
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:11,895
Now, I am gonna
make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

461
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:11,928
Okay.

462
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:13,063
Give me that.

463
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:17,134
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

464
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,737
Don't drink it!
It's for the plants.

465
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,206
What's in Jacksonville?

466
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,243
How did you
know about that?

467
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,180
You didn't
answer my question.

468
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,949
You don't answer
any of mine, so...

469
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,419
I mean,
you don't even
say hi to me.

470
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:36,920
Hi.

471
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,391
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

472
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,995
Yeah. I had
an adrenaline rush.

473
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,431
It's very common.
You can Google it.

474
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,370
Floridians.

475
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:56,206
That's what's
in Jacksonville.

476
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,742
Can you at least
watch where you walk?

477
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,448
Look, I'm sorry
I'm being rude
all the time.

478
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,849
I just think
it's the best way.

479
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:08,218
Bella! Guess who
just asked me to prom.

480
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,887
Who?

481
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,892
Yeah,
I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

482
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:17,260
It's not gonna be weird,
though, right?

483
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,196
No. Zero weirdness.

484
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:19,229
You guys
are great together.

485
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:20,864
I know, right?

486
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:22,232
Tyler...

487
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,167
Gross.

488
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,269
Bella, look. It's a worm.

489
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,705
It's a worm.

490
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,911
Bella,
we shouldn't be friends.

491
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:40,984
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

492
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:42,786
I mean,
why didn't you just
let the van crush me

493
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,888
and save yourself
all this regret?

494
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,192
What, you think
I regret saving you?

495
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,429
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

496
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,766
You don't know anything.

497
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,968
Hi.

498
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,236
Are you gonna be
riding with us?

499
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:00,838
No, our bus is full.

500
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:12,916
Your mom called. Again.

501
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:16,619
Well, that's your fault.

502
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,789
You shouldn't have told her
about the "almost" accident.
You finished?

503
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:19,923
Yeah.

504
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:21,992
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

505
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:24,762
She always did know
how to worry.

506
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,898
She seems different.

507
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,801
She seems happy.

508
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:36,440
Phil sounds like
an all right guy.

509
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,843
Yeah, he is.

510
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,818
All right.

511
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,921
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

512
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,423
No, why do you
keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

513
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:53,456
You're gonna get frostbite!

514
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:56,193
I don't even know.

515
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:00,997
Yeah. Hey!

516
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,999
La Push, baby. You in?

517
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:04,300
Should I know
what that means?

518
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,603
La Push Beach down
at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

519
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,004
Yeah, there's a big
swell coming in.

520
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,973
And I don't just
surf the Internet.

521
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:12,409
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

522
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:14,845
But there's
whale watching, too.
Come with us.

523
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:18,281
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

524
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:20,450
Okay, I'll go if you
stop saying that, okay?

525
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,985
Seriously, dude.
It's creepy, man.

526
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:22,018
What?
That's what it's called.

527
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:23,253
So...

528
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:24,588
Edible art?

529
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,259
Bella.

530
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,795
Thanks.

531
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:35,599
You know, your mood swings are
kind of giving me whiplash.

532
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,202
I only said it'd be better
if we weren't friends,

533
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,470
not that I didn't wanna be.

534
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:43,006
What does that mean?

535
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,477
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

536
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,480
Okay, well, let's say
for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

537
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:51,882
Would you tell me the truth?

538
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,183
No, probably not.

539
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,988
I'd rather hear
your theories.

540
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:01,258
I have considered

541
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,462
radioactive spiders
and Kryptonite.

542
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:09,900
That's all superhero
stuff, right?

543
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,268
What if I'm not the hero?

544
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:12,936
What if I'm the bad guy?

545
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:14,938
You're not.

546
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,475
I can see what
you're trying to put off,

547
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,610
but I can see that
it's just to keep
people away from you.

548
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:21,945
It's a mask.

549
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,620
Why don't we just hang out?

550
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,657
Everybody's going
to the beach.

551
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,192
Come.

552
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:39,663
I mean, have fun.

553
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:43,700
Which beach?

554
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,668
La Push.

555
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,470
I don't know.

556
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:49,506
I just...

557
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,009
Is there something wrong
with that beach?

558
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:56,613
It's just a little crowded.

559
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:02,318
Hey, it's freezing.

560
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:05,622
I'm paddling out, Coates.

561
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,957
I don't know if
it's worth it anymore.

562
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,458
We drove all
the way out here.

563
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:08,491
I'm at least
paddling out.

564
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,293
Yeah.

565
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:10,326
She's right.

566
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,195
You guys are babies.

567
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:15,298
So, I keep thinking
that Eric's gonna
ask me to the prom,

568
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:17,668
and then he just doesn't.

569
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:22,472
You should ask him.

570
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,576
Take control.
You're a strong,
independent woman.

571
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:27,343
I am?

572
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,946
Yes.

573
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:30,546
Hey, will you do me up?

574
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,616
Yeah.

575
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:35,518
Bella!

576
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:36,753
Hi, Jacob.

577
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:36,786
Guys, this is Jacob.

578
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:38,321
Hey, guys. How you doing?

579
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:38,354
Hi.

580
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:39,623
Hi.

581
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,727
What are you, like,
stalking me?

582
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,629
You're on my rez,
remember?

583
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,732
Are you surfing?

584
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:48,765
Definitely not.

585
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,034
Thanks.

586
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,670
You guys should
keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

587
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:54,738
What date?

588
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,706
She invited Edward.

589
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:57,774
To be polite, that's it.

590
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,209
I think it's nice
she invited him.

591
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:00,643
Nobody ever does.

592
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,012
Yeah,
'cause Cullen's a freak.

593
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:03,580
You got that right.

594
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,216
You guys know him?

595
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,218
The Cullens
don't come here.

596
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:21,064
What did your friends
mean about, you know,
"The Cullens don't come here?"

597
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:23,033
You caught that, huh?

598
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:27,571
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

599
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:30,540
Hey, I can keep a secret.

600
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:35,545
Really, it's just like
an old scary story.

601
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,783
Well, I want to know.

602
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:47,224
Okay, did you know
Quileutes are supposedly
descended from wolves?

603
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:50,727
What? Like, wolves?

604
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Yeah.

605
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,729
Like, real wolves?

606
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:56,232
Well, that's
the legend of our tribe.

607
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:57,567
Okay.

608
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,671
So what's the story
about the Cullens?

609
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:05,809
Well, they're supposedly
descended from this,
like, enemy clan.

610
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,448
My great grandfather,
the chief,

611
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,250
found them hunting
on our land.

612
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,486
But they claimed to be
something different,

613
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:19,488
so we made a treaty
with them.

614
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:22,325
If they promised to
stay off Quileute lands,

615
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:25,762
then we wouldn't expose
what they really were
to the palefaces.

616
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:30,499
I thought they
just moved here.

617
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,302
Or just moved back.

618
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:35,304
Right.

619
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,641
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

620
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,512
Well, what are they really?

621
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,281
It's just a story, Bella.

622
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,849
Come on, let's go.

623
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:52,721
A snake! A snake!

624
00:34:57,326 --> 00:35:03,233
♪ My mama said I didn't know
how to make a kitty meow ♪

625
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,608
Hello?

626
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:19,716
Gerald?

627
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,319
Gerald?

628
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:42,806
Hello.

629
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,509
Nice jacket.

630
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:49,779
Who are you?

631
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:52,782
It's always the same
inane questions.

632
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,284
"Who are you?"

633
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,319
"What do you want?"

634
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:58,621
"Why are you
doing this?"

635
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:01,825
James,
let's not play
with our food.

636
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:52,809
He's not here.

637
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:59,349
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

638
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,351
What, do they just ditch?

639
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:05,755
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen
yank them out for, like,
hiking and camping and stuff.

640
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,890
I tried that out
on my parents.
Not even close.

641
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:10,793
Guys, I'm going to
the prom with Eric.

642
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:12,895
I just asked him.
I took control.

643
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:14,697
I told you
that would happen.

644
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,333
Are you sure you
have to go out of town?

645
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:19,802
Oh, yeah,
it's a little
family thing.

646
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:21,371
Okay,
we should go shopping
in Port Angeles

647
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:23,906
before all
the good dresses
get cleaned out.

648
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:29,879
Port Angeles?
You mind if I come?

649
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:31,881
Yeah, I need your opinion.

650
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:33,916
I like this one.

651
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,685
That's cool.

652
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,887
But, like,
I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

653
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:37,920
I like this one.

654
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,489
Yeah,
I like the beading,

655
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:40,757
and you wouldn't
need jewelry.

656
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,758
Jess, what do you think?
Lavender?

657
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:41,791
Is that good?
Is that my color?

658
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,793
I like it.

659
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,862
I liked that
dusty rose one, too.

660
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,363
Okay, I like this one.

661
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:48,765
It makes my boobs
look good.

662
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:48,798
Hey.

663
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:49,866
Right?

664
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,301
Nice.

665
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,369
Oh, God.

666
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,071
That is uncomfortable.

667
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:56,906
That's disgusting.

668
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,708
Bella,
what do you think?

669
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,510
Yes?

670
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,612
That looks great.

671
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:05,615
You said that about,
like, the last five
dresses, though.

672
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,784
I thought they were
all pretty good.

673
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:10,553
You're not really
into this, are you?

674
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:13,923
I actually really
just want to go
to this bookstore.

675
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:15,558
I'll meet you guys
at the restaurant?

676
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:16,826
Are you sure?

677
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,094
Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.

678
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:18,127
Okay.

679
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,696
Okay.

680
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,667
She's right, though.
This looks awesome.

681
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:28,538
There you go.

682
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,074
Have a good night.

683
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,075
Thank you.

684
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,908
Saw you
in the dress store.

685
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,910
Hey, where you running to?

686
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,379
There she is.

687
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:09,412
What's up?

688
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:11,614
It's my girl.

689
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:11,647
How you guys doing?

690
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,149
Look who we just found.

691
00:39:13,182 --> 00:39:16,085
What's up, girl?
Hey... Where you going?

692
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:17,153
Where are you going?

693
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:18,121
Come get
a drink with us.

694
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:18,154
Yeah, you should
hang out with us.

695
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:19,589
Come on.

696
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:20,923
It's fun.

697
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:20,956
What's the problem?

698
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,392
She doesn't like that, man.

699
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:22,425
You're pretty.

700
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,893
Don't touch me.

701
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:23,926
Cute.

702
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:25,862
Really, no.
Seriously, you should.

703
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,530
Don't touch me.

704
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:36,773
Get in the car.

705
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:41,077
That was a very
dangerous maneuver.

706
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,807
I should go back there
and rip those guys'
heads off.

707
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,041
No, you shouldn't.

708
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:14,811
You don't know the vile,
repulsive things
they were thinking.

709
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:15,879
And you do?

710
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:18,782
It's not hard to guess.

711
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,684
Can you talk about
something else?

712
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:23,586
Distract me so
I won't turn around.

713
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,857
You should put
your seatbelt on.

714
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,661
You should put
your seatbelt on.

715
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,201
I thought the salad
was pretty good.

716
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,669
Hey, you guys,
I'm sorry. I just...

717
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,137
Where were you?
We left you messages.

718
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,207
Yeah, we waited,
but we were, like,
starving, so we...

719
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:48,177
I'm sorry I kept
Bella from dinner.

720
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,181
We just sort of
ran into each other
and got talking.

721
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:52,915
Yeah.

722
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,050
No.

723
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:57,754
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

724
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:00,156
Yeah, we were...

725
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,190
We were, yeah,
we were just leaving. So...

726
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,859
Let's get this...

727
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,194
Bella, if you wanna...

728
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:08,130
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

729
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,699
If you'd like.

730
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:13,736
I'll drive you home myself.

731
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:16,105
That's so thoughtful.

732
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,208
It's really thoughtful.
Yeah.

733
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,177
Yeah.
I should eat something.

734
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,679
Yeah.

735
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:23,712
Okay, so we'll
see you tomorrow.

736
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,182
Okay, yeah.

737
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:26,215
See ya.

738
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:27,784
Okay.

739
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:40,897
All right,
one mushroom ravioli.

740
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:43,633
Thanks.

741
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,635
Yeah, no problem.

742
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:47,803
So are you sure
there isn't anything
I can get for you?

743
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,706
No. No, thank you.

744
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,108
Let me know.

745
00:41:58,147 --> 00:41:59,883
You're really not gonna eat?

746
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:04,787
No, I'm on a special diet.

747
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,726
You gotta give me
some answers.

748
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:11,928
Yes, no.

749
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:15,164
To get to the other side.

750
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:18,134
1.77245...

751
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,236
I don't want to know
what the square root
of pi is.

752
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:22,238
You knew that?

753
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:24,206
How did you know where I was?

754
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,875
I didn't.

755
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:27,143
All right.

756
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,844
What?

757
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:30,179
Don't leave. I...

758
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:36,185
Did you follow me?

759
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:43,760
I feel very
protective of you.

760
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:48,163
So you followed me.

761
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:51,367
I was trying to keep
a distance unless
you needed my help,

762
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,605
and then I heard
what those low-lifes
were thinking.

763
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:57,707
Wait.

764
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,209
You say you heard
what they were thinking?

765
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:04,914
So what, you...

766
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,850
You read minds?

767
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:14,591
I can read every
mind in this room.

768
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:17,226
Apart from yours.

769
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:22,865
There's money, sex,

770
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,802
money,

771
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,137
sex,

772
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,606
cat.

773
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:35,144
And then you, nothing.

774
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:39,148
It's very frustrating.

775
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:43,920
Is there something
wrong with me?

776
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:47,890
See, I tell you
I can read minds,

777
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:50,793
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

778
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:00,770
What is it?

779
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:07,176
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

780
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:11,147
Then don't.

781
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:33,703
Okay, I think
I'm warm enough now.

782
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,911
Your hand is so cold.

783
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:54,423
Whoa!

784
00:44:54,456 --> 00:44:56,325
What is going on?

785
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,262
My dad's still here.

786
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:02,231
Can you pull in?

787
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,903
That's my father's
car on the end.

788
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:09,272
What is he doing here?

789
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:14,210
Carlisle,
what's going on?

790
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:19,182
Waylon Forge was
found in a boat
out near his place.

791
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,184
I just examined the body.

792
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,219
He died?

793
00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:25,321
How?

794
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:26,355
Animal attack.

795
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:32,294
Was it the same one that
got that security guard
down in Mason?

796
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:33,829
Most likely.

797
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:34,864
Well, it's getting
closer to town, then.

798
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:37,433
Bella, you should go inside.

799
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:39,935
Waylon was your
father's friend.

800
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:41,270
Okay.

801
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:47,109
I'll see you later.

802
00:45:58,854 --> 00:45:58,854
Hey.

803
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:00,356
Hey.

804
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:06,229
Dad, I'm really sorry.

805
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:13,302
I've known him
going on 30 years.

806
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,287
Don't worry,
we're gonna find
this thing.

807
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:34,123
Meantime,

808
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,860
I want you to
carry this with you.

809
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:40,495
I don't know if you...

810
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:44,333
It'll give your old man
some peace of mind.

811
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:45,401
Okay.

812
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:50,373
Let's go home.

813
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:37,386
Cold One.

814
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:47,350
You're impossibly
fast and strong.

815
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:51,454
Your skin is pale
white and ice-cold.

816
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:55,691
Your eyes change color.

817
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:59,695
And sometimes you speak like
you're from a different time.

818
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,432
You never eat
or drink anything.

819
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:05,267
You don't go out
in the sunlight.

820
00:50:08,703 --> 00:50:10,339
How old are you?

821
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,275
Seventeen.

822
00:50:15,744 --> 00:50:17,446
How long have you been 17?

823
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,418
A while.

824
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:37,366
I know what you are.

825
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:41,303
Say it.

826
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:46,275
Out loud.

827
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:50,346
Say it.

828
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:57,486
Vampire.

829
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:02,691
Are you afraid?

830
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:12,168
No.

831
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:17,506
Then ask me
the most basic question.

832
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,308
What do we eat?

833
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:24,313
You won't hurt me.

834
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:30,753
Where are we going?

835
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,422
Up the mountain.

836
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:35,424
Out of the cloud bank.

837
00:51:35,457 --> 00:51:38,360
You need to see
what I look like
in the sunlight.

838
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,415
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

839
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:02,485
People would know
we're different.

840
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:14,430
This is what I am.

841
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:21,804
It's like diamonds.

842
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:32,281
You're beautiful.

843
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,219
Beautiful?

844
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:39,488
This is the skin
of a killer, Bella.

845
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:47,530
I'm a killer.

846
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:52,534
I don't believe that.

847
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,837
That's because
you believe the lie.

848
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:57,273
It's camouflage.

849
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:03,345
I'm the world's most
dangerous predator.

850
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:06,815
Everything about me
invites you in,

851
00:53:06,848 --> 00:53:10,286
my voice, my face,
even my smell.

852
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:13,956
As if I would
need any of that.

853
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,527
As if you could outrun me!

854
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,535
As if you could
fight me off.

855
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,208
I'm designed to kill.

856
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,512
I don't care.

857
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:39,448
I've killed
people before.

858
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,252
It does not matter.

859
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,525
I wanted to kill you.

860
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:57,466
I've never wanted
a human's blood
so much in my life.

861
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:00,402
I trust you.

862
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:04,306
Don't.

863
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:07,476
I'm here. I trust you.

864
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:15,517
My family,
we're different from
others of our kind.

865
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,419
We only hunt animals.

866
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:19,722
We've learned to
control our thirst.

867
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:23,292
But it's you, your scent,

868
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,830
it's like a drug to me.

869
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:33,302
You're like my own
personal brand of heroin.

870
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:43,445
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

871
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:45,480
I did.

872
00:54:45,513 --> 00:54:48,817
Only for making me
want you so badly.

873
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,487
I still don't know
if I can control myself.

874
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:55,291
I know you can.

875
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:06,468
I can't read your mind.

876
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:09,305
You have to tell me
what you're thinking.

877
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:13,409
Now I'm afraid.

878
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,748
Good.

879
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:22,785
I'm not afraid of you.

880
00:55:26,855 --> 00:55:28,457
I'm only afraid
of losing you.

881
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,092
I feel like you're
gonna disappear.

882
00:55:38,066 --> 00:55:40,769
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

883
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:51,747
So the lion
fell in love
with the lamb.

884
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:57,486
What a stupid lamb.

885
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,822
What a sick,
masochistic lion.

886
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:30,745
About three things
I was absolutely positive.

887
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:32,047
First,

888
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:34,783
Edward was a vampire.

889
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:40,722
Second,

890
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:43,758
there was a part of him,

891
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,727
and I didn't know
how dominant
that part might be,

892
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:48,997
that thirsted for my blood.

893
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:56,037
And third,

894
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,508
I was unconditionally
and irrevocably
in love with him.

895
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:08,717
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

896
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:12,921
Gambling, tuxedos,
and Bond, James Bond.

897
00:58:17,091 --> 00:58:19,261
Oh, my God.

898
00:58:28,002 --> 00:58:29,237
Wow.

899
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,509
You know,
everybody's staring.

900
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:40,816
Not that guy.
No, he just looked.

901
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:46,254
I'm breaking all
the rules now anyway.

902
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:48,023
Since I'm going to hell.

903
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:55,297
So, does a person
have to be dying

904
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:00,569
to become like you?

905
00:59:00,602 --> 00:59:03,305
No, that's just Carlisle.

906
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:08,310
He'd never do this
to someone who
had another choice.

907
00:59:10,111 --> 00:59:12,881
So, how long have
you been like this?

908
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:16,251
Since 1918.

909
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:19,821
That's when Carlisle
found me dying
of Spanish influenza.

910
00:59:22,056 --> 00:59:23,024
What was it like?

911
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:27,729
The venom was excruciating.

912
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:29,831
But what Carlisle did
was much harder.

913
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:32,267
Not many of us have
the restraint to do that.

914
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,803
But didn't he
just have to bite?

915
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:38,307
Not exactly.

916
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,842
When we taste

917
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:46,281
human blood,
a sort of frenzy begins,

918
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:50,285
and it's almost
impossible to stop.

919
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,723
But Carlisle did.

920
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:57,359
First with me
and then with his wife, Esme.

921
00:59:57,392 --> 01:00:01,830
So is Carlisle
the real reason that
you don't kill people?

922
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,903
No, he's not
the only reason.

923
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:12,908
I don't want
to be a monster.

924
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:18,980
My family,
we think of ourselves
as vegetarians, right,

925
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:22,050
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.

926
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,853
But it's...

927
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:27,389
It's like a human
only living on tofu.

928
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:31,860
It keeps you strong,
but you're never
fully satisfied.

929
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:38,266
It wouldn't be like
drinking your blood,
for instance.

930
01:00:44,005 --> 01:00:47,008
Was it other vampires
that killed Waylon?

931
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:48,343
Yeah.

932
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:52,347
There are others out there,
and we run into them
from time to time.

933
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:58,286
Can the rest of
your family read people's
minds like you can?

934
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:03,291
No. That's just me.

935
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:06,895
But Alice
can see the future.

936
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:09,931
I bet she saw me coming.

937
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:14,369
Alice's visions
are subjective.

938
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:16,938
I mean, the future
can always change.

939
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:29,117
Could you act human?

940
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,351
I mean,
I've got neighbors.

941
01:01:30,384 --> 01:01:32,954
I'm gonna take you
to my place tomorrow.

942
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,791
Thanks.

943
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:37,859
Wait, like,
with your family?

944
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,762
Yeah.

945
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:43,932
What if they
don't like me?

946
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:47,736
So, you're worried
not because you'll be in
a house full of vampires,

947
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:50,972
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

948
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:52,774
I'm glad I amuse you.

949
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:55,844
What is it?

950
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:58,880
Complication.

951
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:02,851
I'll pick you
up tomorrow.

952
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:31,346
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

953
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:35,316
Looks good.
Got that dent out.

954
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,349
Yeah.

955
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:38,019
Actually, we came to
visit your flat-screen.

956
01:02:38,052 --> 01:02:40,288
First Mariners game
of the season.

957
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:44,025
Plus Jacob here
keeps bugging me about
seeing you again.

958
01:02:44,058 --> 01:02:46,027
Great, Dad. Thanks.

959
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,996
Just keeping it real, son.

960
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,299
Vitamin R.

961
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:53,301
Well done, Chief.

962
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:55,537
Harry Clearwater's
homemade fish fry.

963
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,972
Good man.

964
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:01,543
Any luck with
that Waylon case?

965
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:04,312
Well, I don't think
it was an animal
that killed him.

966
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:06,081
Never thought it was.

967
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:09,884
So spread the word
out at the rez, huh?

968
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:11,085
Keep the kids
out of the woods.

969
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:13,421
Will do.

970
01:03:13,454 --> 01:03:16,091
Don't want no one else
getting hurt, do we?

971
01:03:48,956 --> 01:03:49,891
Whoa.

972
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:52,828
This is incredible.

973
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,834
It's so light and open,
you know?

974
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:04,873
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons
and moats?

975
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,942
No, not the moats.

976
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:09,578
Not the moats.

977
01:04:16,617 --> 01:04:19,287
This is the one place
we don't have to hide.

978
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:23,791
I told them
not to do this.

979
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:27,996
You add
a little bit of olive oil
to a non-stick saute pan,

980
01:04:28,029 --> 01:04:31,266
and you want to cook
with the olive oil
in medium-high heat.

981
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:35,036
What I do,
I cut this in strips,
and then we gonna cut this...

982
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:36,271
Is she even Italian?

983
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:38,306
Her name is Bella.

984
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:41,309
I'm sure she'll love it,
no matter what.

985
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:43,478
Get a whiff of that.

986
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:45,513
Here comes the human.

987
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:51,953
Bella, we're making
Italiano for you.

988
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:55,490
Bella, this is Esme.

989
01:04:55,523 --> 01:04:57,959
My mother for all
intents and purposes.

990
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:02,964
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen
for the first time.

991
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:03,965
I hope you're hungry.

992
01:05:03,998 --> 01:05:05,199
Yeah, absolutely.

993
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:06,468
She already ate.

994
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:15,209
Perfect.

995
01:05:15,242 --> 01:05:19,280
Yeah, it's just because
I know that you guys
don't eat...

996
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,683
Of course. It's very
considerate of you.

997
01:05:21,716 --> 01:05:21,716
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.

998
01:05:21,716 --> 01:05:24,485
Yeah.

999
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:27,455
Let's just keep pretending
like this isn't dangerous
for all of us.

1000
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:30,926
I would never tell
anybody anything.

1001
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:33,962
She knows that.

1002
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:36,731
Yeah, well,
the problem is, you two
have gone public now, so...

1003
01:05:36,764 --> 01:05:37,732
Emmett.

1004
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:39,968
No, she should know.

1005
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,204
The entire family
will be implicated
if this ends badly.

1006
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:45,307
Badly, as in...

1007
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:49,277
I would become the meal.

1008
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:58,019
Hi, Bella.

1009
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,491
I'm Alice.

1010
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:04,358
Hi.

1011
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:05,593
Hi.

1012
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,630
You do smell good.

1013
01:06:09,663 --> 01:06:10,798
Alice, what are you...

1014
01:06:10,831 --> 01:06:14,202
It's okay.
Bella and I are
gonna be great friends.

1015
01:06:17,805 --> 01:06:20,308
Sorry, Jasper's our
newest vegetarian.

1016
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:22,510
It's a little
difficult for him.

1017
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,479
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1018
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:26,748
It's okay, Jasper.
You won't hurt her.

1019
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:32,220
All right, I'm gonna
take you on a tour of
the rest of the house.

1020
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:33,254
Okay.

1021
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:34,655
Well, I'll see you soon.

1022
01:06:34,688 --> 01:06:35,623
Okay.

1023
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:37,792
Cute!

1024
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:39,260
I know.

1025
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:41,229
I think that went well.

1026
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:43,731
Clean this up. Now.

1027
01:06:43,764 --> 01:06:47,068
Was that as weird for
you as it was for me?

1028
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,603
I don't know.

1029
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:55,744
Graduation caps?

1030
01:06:57,478 --> 01:06:59,748
Yeah. It's a private joke.

1031
01:07:01,082 --> 01:07:02,650
We matriculate a lot.

1032
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:06,554
That's kind of miserable.

1033
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:09,524
I mean,
repeating high school
over and over.

1034
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:11,459
True, but the younger
we start out in a new place,

1035
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:13,728
the longer we can stay there.

1036
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,030
Come on.

1037
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:27,275
Yeah, this is my room.

1038
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:41,489
No bed?

1039
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,558
No, I don't...

1040
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:45,727
I don't sleep.

1041
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:47,795
Ever?

1042
01:07:47,828 --> 01:07:48,797
No, not at all.

1043
01:07:52,366 --> 01:07:53,568
Okay.

1044
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,279
Boy, you have so much music.

1045
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:07,348
What are you listening to?

1046
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:12,287
It's Debussy.

1047
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:14,788
I don't know...

1048
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:16,591
Yeah.

1049
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:22,630
Claire De Lune  is great.

1050
01:08:57,363 --> 01:08:58,798
What?

1051
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:00,268
I can't dance.

1052
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,613
Well, I could
always make you.

1053
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:15,550
I'm not scared of you.

1054
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,356
Well, you really
shouldn't have said that.

1055
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:29,697
You better hold on tight,
spider monkey.

1056
01:09:34,768 --> 01:09:36,304
Do you trust me?

1057
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,339
In theory.

1058
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,742
Then close your eyes.

1059
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:06,634
What?

1060
01:10:08,402 --> 01:10:10,638
This isn't real.

1061
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:12,840
This kind of stuff
just doesn't exist.

1062
01:10:12,873 --> 01:10:14,676
It does in my world.

1063
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:45,833
Hold up.

1064
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:52,740
It's human.

1065
01:11:56,944 --> 01:12:00,381
Arizona.
Yo, what's happening?

1066
01:12:00,414 --> 01:12:02,516
So you and Cullen, huh?

1067
01:12:02,549 --> 01:12:04,752
That's...
I don't like it.

1068
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:07,655
I mean, I don't know,

1069
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:10,658
he just looks at you
like you're something
to eat.

1070
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,630
Here's your veggie
plate, Stephenie.

1071
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:18,766
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Biology project.

1072
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,535
I ordered you
the spinach salad.

1073
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:23,104
I hope that's okay.

1074
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:24,872
You should order one
for yourself next time.

1075
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:27,541
Cut back on the steak.

1076
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:29,677
Hey, I'm as healthy
as a horse.

1077
01:12:30,844 --> 01:12:33,081
Say, Chief,
boys want to know,

1078
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,819
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

1079
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:43,557
Yeah, we found
a bare human footprint,

1080
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,793
but it looks like
whoever that is,
is headed east,

1081
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:48,596
so Kitsap County sheriff
is gonna take over from here.

1082
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:48,629
Okay.

1083
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,564
Okay?

1084
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:52,734
I just hope
they catch him fast.

1085
01:13:01,975 --> 01:13:04,679
Looks like your friends
are flagging you.

1086
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:08,616
It's okay if you
wanna go join them.

1087
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:10,851
I'm just gonna
turn in early anyway.

1088
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,586
Me, too.

1089
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:16,123
Bella, it's Friday night.
Go out.

1090
01:13:16,156 --> 01:13:18,726
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

1091
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:21,695
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

1092
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:23,898
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?

1093
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,767
Anybody interest you?

1094
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:29,637
Dad, we gonna
talk about boys?

1095
01:13:31,138 --> 01:13:33,674
Yeah, I guess not.

1096
01:13:33,707 --> 01:13:37,178
I just feel like
I leave you alone
too much.

1097
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:39,113
You should be around people.

1098
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:43,717
I don't really
mind being alone.

1099
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,721
I guess I'm kind of
like my dad in that way.

1100
01:13:51,124 --> 01:13:54,128
So, how's all
the baseball stuff going?

1101
01:13:54,161 --> 01:13:56,197
Phil's working so hard.

1102
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,200
You know,
spring training.

1103
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:02,102
We're looking for a house
to rent in case things
become more permanent.

1104
01:14:02,135 --> 01:14:03,204
You'd like Jacksonville,
baby.

1105
01:14:03,237 --> 01:14:04,872
Yeah?

1106
01:14:04,905 --> 01:14:06,807
I'm really liking Forks.

1107
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,875
What?

1108
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:11,846
Forks is growing on me.

1109
01:14:11,879 --> 01:14:14,849
Could a guy
have anything
to do with that?

1110
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:17,218
Well, yeah.

1111
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:21,155
I knew it.
Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

1112
01:14:21,188 --> 01:14:23,157
I bet he's smart.
Is he smart?

1113
01:14:25,259 --> 01:14:27,828
Mom, can I talk to you later?

1114
01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:30,765
Come on,
we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

1115
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:38,606
How did you get in here?

1116
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:40,608
The window.

1117
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:42,176
Do you do that a lot?

1118
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,847
Well, just the past
couple of months.

1119
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:51,886
I like watching you sleep.

1120
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:57,124
It's kind of
fascinating to me.

1121
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:03,898
I always want
to try one thing.

1122
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,134
Just stay very still.

1123
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:15,710
Don't move.

1124
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:01,188
Stop it!

1125
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,126
I'm sorry.

1126
01:16:09,096 --> 01:16:10,998
I'm stronger
than I thought.

1127
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:14,035
Yeah. I wish
I could say the same.

1128
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:21,576
I can't ever lose
control with you.

1129
01:16:27,781 --> 01:16:29,584
Hey, don't go.

1130
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,699
Hey, got you another one.

1131
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:20,067
Thanks.

1132
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,269
I have a date
with Edward Cullen.

1133
01:17:24,237 --> 01:17:26,674
He's a little old
for you, isn't he?

1134
01:17:27,107 --> 01:17:29,043
No.

1135
01:17:29,076 --> 01:17:31,779
He's a junior.
I'm a junior.

1136
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:34,782
I thought you
liked the Cullens.

1137
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:37,284
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

1138
01:17:37,317 --> 01:17:39,220
Edward doesn't live in town.

1139
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:41,689
Technically.

1140
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:46,093
He's right outside.

1141
01:17:46,727 --> 01:17:48,195
He is?

1142
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:51,032
Yeah, he wanted to
meet you, officially.

1143
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:55,302
All right. Bring him in.

1144
01:17:57,504 --> 01:17:59,140
Could you be nice?

1145
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:02,043
He's important.

1146
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,322
Chief Swan.

1147
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:18,759
I want to formally
introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

1148
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:20,094
Hi, Edward.

1149
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:22,163
Bella won't be out
too late tonight.

1150
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:24,798
She's just gonna play
baseball with my family.

1151
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:25,966
Baseball?

1152
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:28,068
Yes, sir,
that's the plan.

1153
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:30,037
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1154
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:33,140
Well, good luck with that.

1155
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:35,743
I'll take
good care of her.
I promise.

1156
01:18:38,812 --> 01:18:40,047
Hey.

1157
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:43,217
Still got that
pepper spray?

1158
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,251
Yeah, Dad.

1159
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,926
And since when do
vampires like baseball?

1160
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:55,496
Well,
it's the American pastime,

1161
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:58,165
and there's
a thunderstorm coming.

1162
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:00,501
It's the only time
we can play.
You'll see why.

1163
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:15,015
Hey.

1164
01:19:15,049 --> 01:19:17,251
Glad you're here.
We need an umpire.

1165
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:18,819
She thinks we cheat.

1166
01:19:18,852 --> 01:19:20,254
I know you cheat.

1167
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:23,957
Call them as you
see them, Bella.

1168
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:25,259
Okay.

1169
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:36,103
It's time.

1170
01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:47,214
Okay, now I see why
you need the thunder.

1171
01:19:52,152 --> 01:19:54,521
That's gotta be
a home run, right?

1172
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:57,357
Edward's very fast.

Stop!

1194
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:39,226
They were leaving.
Then they heard us.

1195
01:21:39,259 --> 01:21:40,260
Let's go.

1196
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:41,095
It's too late.

1197
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:44,231
Get your hair down.

1198
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:49,136
Like that'll help.
I can smell her
from across the field.

1199
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:57,377
I shouldn't have
brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

1200
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:58,211
What? What are you...

1201
01:21:58,244 --> 01:22:00,547
Just be quiet
and stand behind me.

1202
01:22:22,402 --> 01:22:24,605
I believe this
belongs to you.

1203
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:29,042
Thank you.

1204
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:30,978
I am Laurent.

1205
01:22:31,011 --> 01:22:33,013
And this is Victoria

1206
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,650
and James.

1207
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:39,219
I'm Carlisle.
This is my family.

1208
01:22:41,321 --> 01:22:42,622
Hello.

1209
01:22:42,655 --> 01:22:44,191
I'm afraid your
hunting activities

1210
01:22:44,224 --> 01:22:46,293
have caused something
of a mess for us.

1211
01:22:46,326 --> 01:22:48,395
Our apologies.

1212
01:22:48,428 --> 01:22:51,365
We didn't realize
the territory
had been claimed.

1213
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:54,301
Yes, well,
we maintain a permanent
residence nearby.

1214
01:22:56,269 --> 01:22:57,338
Really?

1215
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:03,077
Well, we won't be
a problem anymore.

1216
01:23:04,377 --> 01:23:06,179
We were just passing through.

1217
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:08,682
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1218
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:10,551
You should be safe.

1219
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:12,619
Excellent.

1220
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:15,455
So,

1221
01:23:15,488 --> 01:23:17,558
could you use
three more players?

1222
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:21,562
Come on. Just one game.

1223
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:24,664
Sure. Why not?

1224
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:27,200
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1225
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:28,635
We'll bat first.

1226
01:23:30,136 --> 01:23:32,406
I'm the one with
the wicked curveball.

1227
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,441
Well, I think
we can handle that.

1228
01:23:36,109 --> 01:23:37,444
We shall see.

1229
01:23:57,764 --> 01:23:59,566
You brought a snack.

1230
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:03,470
A human?

1231
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:09,109
The girl is with us.

1232
01:24:09,142 --> 01:24:11,111
I think it best
if you leave.

1233
01:24:14,747 --> 01:24:16,616
I can see the game is over.

1234
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:18,352
We'll go now.

1235
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:22,656
James.

1236
01:24:35,435 --> 01:24:37,370
Get Bella out of here.

1237
01:24:37,403 --> 01:24:38,472
Go.

1238
01:24:49,149 --> 01:24:51,652
Okay, I've got it!
I've got it!
I'm all right!

1239
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:55,689
What,
now he's coming
after me?

1240
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:07,334
Listen to me.
James is a tracker.

1241
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:08,702
The hunt is his obsession.

1242
01:25:08,735 --> 01:25:09,903
I read his mind.

1243
01:25:09,936 --> 01:25:11,671
My reaction on
the field set him off.

1244
01:25:11,704 --> 01:25:15,375
I just made this
his most exciting
game ever.

1245
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:15,408
He's never gonna stop.

1246
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:16,710
What should we do?

1247
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:18,178
We have to kill him.

1248
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:20,614
Rip him apart
and burn the pieces.

1249
01:25:20,647 --> 01:25:20,647
Where we going?

1250
01:25:20,647 --> 01:25:22,482
Away from Forks.

1251
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:23,650
We'll get a ferry
to Vancouver.

1252
01:25:23,683 --> 01:25:25,485
I have to go home. Now.

1253
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:25,518
You have to take me home.

1254
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:28,755
You can't go home.

1255
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:30,524
He's just gonna
trace your scent there.

1256
01:25:30,557 --> 01:25:31,758
It's the first place
he's gonna look.

1257
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,926
But my dad is there. We...

1258
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:33,960
It doesn't matter!

1259
01:25:33,994 --> 01:25:38,365
Yes, it does!
He could get killed
because of us!

1260
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:40,333
Just let me get you
out of here first,
all right?

1261
01:25:40,366 --> 01:25:42,903
It's my dad!
We have to go back!

1262
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:44,671
We'll figure a way
to lead the tracker
away somehow.

1263
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:47,474
I don't know.
But we have to
do something.

1264
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:54,381
Edward,
I said leave me alone.

1265
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:55,215
Bella, don't do this, please.

1266
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:57,184
It's over! Get out!

1267
01:25:57,217 --> 01:25:58,618
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1268
01:25:58,651 --> 01:26:01,488
Bella? What's going on?

1269
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:04,391
I just gotta
get out of here.
I'm leaving now.

1270
01:26:06,392 --> 01:26:07,461
Hey.

1271
01:26:10,663 --> 01:26:12,232
Bella?

1272
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:14,935
What am I gonna
say to him?

1273
01:26:14,968 --> 01:26:17,204
I can't hurt him.

1274
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:17,237
Bella, what's going on?

1275
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:19,640
You just have to.

1276
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,476
I'll be down
at the truck.

1277
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,483
Did he hurt you?

1278
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:31,451
No.

1279
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,223
Break up with you
or something?

1280
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:37,925
No, I broke up
with him.

1281
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:42,496
I thought you liked him.

1282
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:47,234
Yeah, that's why
I have to leave.

1283
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,536
I don't want this.
I have to go home.

1284
01:26:51,638 --> 01:26:53,240
Home? Your...

1285
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:55,742
Your mom's
not even in Phoenix.

1286
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:57,477
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1287
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,913
You're not gonna
drive home right now.

1288
01:26:59,946 --> 01:27:02,983
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like
going in the morning,

1289
01:27:03,016 --> 01:27:03,750
I'll take you to the airport.

1290
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:05,619
No. I want to drive.

1291
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:07,654
It'll give me
more time to think.

1292
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:09,022
I mean,
if I get really tired,

1293
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:10,724
I'll pull into a motel.
I promise.

1294
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:13,627
Look, Bella,
I know I'm not that
much fun to be around,

1295
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,028
but I can change that.

1296
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:17,531
We can do more
stuff together.

1297
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:22,602
Like what?

1298
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:25,038
Like watch baseball
on the flat-screen?

1299
01:27:25,071 --> 01:27:26,573
Eat at the diner
every night?

1300
01:27:26,606 --> 01:27:28,408
Steak and cobbler?

1301
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:30,477
Dad, that's you.
That's not me.

1302
01:27:34,047 --> 01:27:35,782
Bella, come on,
I just...

1303
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:37,751
I just got you back.

1304
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:42,989
Yeah, and, you know,
if I don't get out now,

1305
01:27:43,022 --> 01:27:45,726
then I'm just gonna be
stuck here like Mom.

1306
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,552
Your father's
gonna forgive you.

1307
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,423
Why don't you let me drive?

1308
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:23,597
He won't.

1309
01:28:24,697 --> 01:28:26,600
You should've seen his face.

1310
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:30,437
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him

1311
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:32,405
when she was leaving him.

1312
01:28:32,438 --> 01:28:34,541
It's the only way
he'd let you go.

1313
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,045
Just don't worry
about him now.

1314
01:28:39,078 --> 01:28:41,681
He's safe.
The tracker's following us.

1315
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:45,685
Oh, God.

1316
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:46,553
It's just Emmett.

1317
01:28:49,021 --> 01:28:50,991
Alice is in
the car behind us.

1318
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:13,780
Wait.

1319
01:29:15,448 --> 01:29:18,017
He came to warn
us about James.

1320
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,055
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired
of his games,

1321
01:29:22,088 --> 01:29:25,058
but he's got
unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1322
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:28,395
I've never seen
anything like him
in my 300 years.

1323
01:29:28,428 --> 01:29:31,698
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1324
01:29:37,036 --> 01:29:38,004
I've had to fight
our kind before.

1325
01:29:38,037 --> 01:29:39,072
We're not easy to kill.

1326
01:29:39,105 --> 01:29:40,574
But not impossible.

1327
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:43,810
We'll tear them apart
and burn the pieces.

1328
01:29:43,843 --> 01:29:45,779
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1329
01:29:45,812 --> 01:29:48,181
even a sadistic
one like James.

1330
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:50,049
What if he kills
one of us first?

1331
01:29:50,082 --> 01:29:51,718
I'm gonna run
Bella south.

1332
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:52,919
Can you lead the tracker
away from here?

1333
01:29:52,952 --> 01:29:55,021
No, Edward.
James knows you would
never leave Bella.

1334
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:55,054
He'll follow you.

1335
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:57,056
I'll go with Bella.

1336
01:29:57,089 --> 01:29:59,025
Jasper and I
will drive her south.

1337
01:29:59,058 --> 01:30:00,693
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1338
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:02,061
Can you keep your
thoughts to yourself?

1339
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:03,597
Yes.

1340
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:10,737
Rosalie, Esme,

1341
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:14,508
could you put these on
so the tracker will
pick up Bella's scent?

1342
01:30:16,843 --> 01:30:19,512
Why? What is she to me?

1343
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:22,482
Rosalie,
Bella is with Edward.

1344
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:24,518
She's part of
this family now,

1345
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:28,021
and we protect our family.

1346
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:47,774
Oh, God. If anything...

1347
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:49,075
What if...

1348
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:51,010
If anything happens,
I swear to God...

1349
01:30:51,043 --> 01:30:53,046
Nothing's gonna happen.

1350
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:55,748
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1351
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:59,619
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back
and get you.

1352
01:30:59,652 --> 01:31:00,554
Yeah.

1353
01:31:01,254 --> 01:31:03,590
Bella,
you are my life now.

1354
01:31:21,007 --> 01:31:23,042
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1355
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:25,044
You must have
let your phone die
or something.

1356
01:31:25,077 --> 01:31:28,982
I'm not in Forks,
but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1357
01:31:36,656 --> 01:31:38,592
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1358
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,262
That's good.

1359
01:32:29,308 --> 01:32:31,077
What is it?
What do you see?

1360
01:32:43,289 --> 01:32:45,091
He's figured it out.

1361
01:32:45,124 --> 01:32:47,661
The tracker,
he just changed course.

1362
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:49,762
Where will it
take him, Alice?

1363
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:51,230
Mirrors.

1364
01:32:51,263 --> 01:32:53,099
A room full of mirrors.

1365
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,840
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1366
01:33:00,873 --> 01:33:03,276
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1367
01:33:03,309 --> 01:33:05,378
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1368
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:07,747
Okay, so the course that
the tracker's on now

1369
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,050
is gonna lead him
to a ballet studio?

1370
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,118
You've been here?

1371
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:13,687
I took lessons as a kid.

1372
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:16,789
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1373
01:33:16,822 --> 01:33:17,824
Was your school
here in Phoenix?

1374
01:33:17,857 --> 01:33:19,258
Yeah.

1375
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:21,127
Edward, are you okay?

1376
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:23,096
We've lost the tracker.

1377
01:33:23,129 --> 01:33:24,998
The woman's
still in the area.

1378
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:27,367
Rosalie and Esme
are going back to Forks
to protect your father.

1379
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:33,239
I'm coming to get you.
Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1380
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:35,241
And the others
will keep hunting.

1381
01:33:35,274 --> 01:33:38,078
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1382
01:33:50,289 --> 01:33:52,325
Hey, Mom,
I'm glad you got my message.

1383
01:33:52,358 --> 01:33:53,760
What are you doing home?

1384
01:33:53,793 --> 01:33:56,096
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1385
01:33:57,129 --> 01:33:58,765
Calm down,
everything's fine.

1386
01:33:58,798 --> 01:34:00,099
Bella? Bella?

1387
01:34:00,132 --> 01:34:03,002
I'll explain
everything later.

1388
01:34:03,035 --> 01:34:04,537
Mom, are you there?

1389
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:08,241
Forks High School
doesn't protect its students'
privacy very well.

1390
01:34:08,274 --> 01:34:12,445
It was just too easy
for Victoria to find
your previous address.

1391
01:34:12,478 --> 01:34:15,081
It's a nice house
you have here.

1392
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:16,783
I was prepared
to wait for you,

1393
01:34:16,816 --> 01:34:22,755
but then Mom came home
after she received a very
worried call from your dad,

1394
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:24,791
and it all worked
out quite well.

1395
01:34:25,858 --> 01:34:27,093
Wait, wait...

1396
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:28,394
Don't touch her! Don't...

1397
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:28,427
You can still save her.

1398
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:30,797
Don't!

1399
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,099
But you're gonna
have to get away
from your friends.

1400
01:34:33,132 --> 01:34:34,801
Can you handle that?

1401
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:36,069
Where should I meet you?

1402
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:41,340
How about your
old ballet studio?

1403
01:34:41,373 --> 01:34:44,010
And I'll know if you
bring anyone along.

1404
01:34:46,278 --> 01:34:49,282
Poor Mommy would
pay the price
for that mistake.

1405
01:35:06,398 --> 01:35:10,303
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

1406
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:14,374
But dying in the place
of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.

1407
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:24,851
I can't bring myself
to regret the decisions

1408
01:35:24,884 --> 01:35:27,386
that brought me
face-to-face with death.

1409
01:35:27,419 --> 01:35:29,389
They also
brought me to Edward.

1410
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:01,888
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1411
01:36:01,921 --> 01:36:01,921
Mom?

1412
01:36:01,921 --> 01:36:03,022
Bella?

1413
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:03,055
Mom?

1414
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:04,824
There you are.

1415
01:36:04,857 --> 01:36:06,359
What are you
doing in here?

1416
01:36:06,392 --> 01:36:09,128
Everyone makes fun of me.

1417
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:12,431
Come on,
you're a wonderful dancer.

1418
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:14,433
Mom, I suck.

1419
01:36:15,935 --> 01:36:17,370
You do not suck.

1420
01:36:27,947 --> 01:36:29,449
That's my favorite part.

1421
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:33,286
You were a stubborn child,
weren't you?

1422
01:36:35,454 --> 01:36:36,455
She's not even here.

1423
01:36:36,488 --> 01:36:37,323
No.

1424
01:36:39,558 --> 01:36:41,561
Sorry.

1425
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:44,964
You know, but you really
made it too easy.

1426
01:36:44,997 --> 01:36:48,901
So to make things
more entertaining,

1427
01:36:48,934 --> 01:36:51,504
I'm gonna make
a little film of
our time together.

1428
01:36:53,472 --> 01:36:55,408
I borrowed this
from your house.

1429
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:56,909
I hope you don't mind.

1430
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:58,177
Good.

1431
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,312
And

1432
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:01,948
action.

1433
01:37:04,483 --> 01:37:06,219
That'll break
Edward's little heart.

1434
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:07,453
You have...

1435
01:37:07,486 --> 01:37:08,421
Edward has nothing
to do with this!

1436
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,356
But he does.

1437
01:37:11,457 --> 01:37:14,293
His rage will make for
more interesting sport

1438
01:37:14,326 --> 01:37:17,363
than his feeble attempt
to protect you.

1439
01:37:18,597 --> 01:37:20,433
And let's continue.

1440
01:37:36,048 --> 01:37:38,985
Beautiful.
Very visually dynamic.

1441
01:37:42,054 --> 01:37:44,190
I chose my stage well.

1442
01:37:49,595 --> 01:37:53,332
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1443
01:37:53,365 --> 01:37:55,968
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1444
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:57,937
It's cruel, really.

1445
01:38:02,608 --> 01:38:05,278
Tell Edward
how much it hurts.

1446
01:38:05,311 --> 01:38:06,579
Tell him to avenge you.
Tell him!

1447
01:38:06,612 --> 01:38:07,914
No, Edward, don't!

1448
01:38:07,947 --> 01:38:09,515
Tell him! Tell him!

1449
01:38:22,394 --> 01:38:25,431
You're alone
'cause you're faster
than the others.

1450
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,402
But not stronger.

1451
01:38:31,236 --> 01:38:33,406
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1452
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,948
I'm sorry.

1453
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:46,779
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1454
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:49,315
Son. Enough.

1455
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:52,051
Remember who you are.

1456
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,424
Bella, you're okay.

1457
01:39:58,457 --> 01:39:59,759
Bella needs you.

1458
01:40:00,492 --> 01:40:02,194
It's okay.

1459
01:40:02,227 --> 01:40:03,363
Oh, God.

1460
01:40:07,433 --> 01:40:09,402
Carlisle? Her blood.

1461
01:40:09,435 --> 01:40:09,435
Your brothers will
take care of him.

1462
01:40:09,435 --> 01:40:11,237
I got him.

1463
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,270
Carlisle!

1464
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:12,405
Start the fire.

1465
01:40:12,438 --> 01:40:15,207
Get the floorboards.

1466
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,375
Alice!

1467
01:40:16,408 --> 01:40:17,343
Alice, go.

1468
01:40:27,553 --> 01:40:29,455
Her femoral artery's
been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1469
01:40:29,488 --> 01:40:31,424
No, no, my head is burning!

1470
01:40:33,092 --> 01:40:35,761
It's the venom.

1471
01:40:35,794 --> 01:40:39,398
You have to make a choice.
You could let
the change happen.

1472
01:40:39,431 --> 01:40:40,533
No.

1473
01:40:41,433 --> 01:40:42,502
No.

1474
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:46,305
It's gonna happen, Edward.
I've seen it.

1475
01:40:46,338 --> 01:40:48,074
It doesn't have
to be that way.

1476
01:40:48,107 --> 01:40:49,042
She's still hemorrhaging.

1477
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:51,210
Alice,
make me a tourniquet.
Your belt.

1478
01:40:51,243 --> 01:40:53,412
Carlisle,
what's my other option?

1479
01:40:54,513 --> 01:40:56,449
Tie it above my hands.

1480
01:40:56,482 --> 01:40:57,784
Carlisle!

1481
01:40:59,785 --> 01:41:01,354
Go.

1482
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:07,393
We could try to
suck the venom out.

1483
01:41:07,426 --> 01:41:08,761
You know I won't
be able to stop.

1484
01:41:08,794 --> 01:41:10,563
Then find the will to stop.

1485
01:41:11,597 --> 01:41:13,432
But choose.

1486
01:41:13,465 --> 01:41:15,368
She only has minutes left.

1487
01:41:17,803 --> 01:41:20,406
I'm gonna make
it go away, Bella.

1488
01:41:22,608 --> 01:41:24,444
I'm gonna make it go away.

1489
01:41:42,794 --> 01:41:44,497
Edward, stop.

1490
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:45,832
Her blood is clean.
You're killing her.

1491
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:48,334
Edward.

1492
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,836
Stop.

1493
01:41:51,436 --> 01:41:52,338
Stop.

1494
01:41:53,872 --> 01:41:55,774
Find the will.

1495
01:42:20,365 --> 01:42:23,402
Death is peaceful, easy.

1496
01:42:30,842 --> 01:42:32,345
Life is harder.

1497
01:42:37,816 --> 01:42:39,385
Bella?

1498
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,355
Baby?

1499
01:42:43,922 --> 01:42:45,391
Bella.

1500
01:42:46,925 --> 01:42:46,925
Mom?

1501
01:42:46,925 --> 01:42:48,427
Hey.

1502
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:50,796
Where is he?

1503
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:52,598
Where's...

1504
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:54,500
Where's Edward?

1505
01:42:54,533 --> 01:42:55,801
He's asleep.

1506
01:42:56,935 --> 01:42:58,537
He never leaves.

1507
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:01,374
And your dad,
he's down at the cafeteria.

1508
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:04,343
What happened?

1509
01:43:04,376 --> 01:43:06,812
Well, when you fell,
you broke your leg,

1510
01:43:07,879 --> 01:43:10,616
and you lost a lot of blood.

1511
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:13,352
You don't remember
any of this, do you?

1512
01:43:15,287 --> 01:43:16,822
Edward came down with his dad

1513
01:43:16,855 --> 01:43:19,425
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.

1514
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:22,795
So you went over
to their hotel,
then you tripped,

1515
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:25,364
and you fell down
two flights of stairs.

1516
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,833
Went through a window.

1517
01:43:34,306 --> 01:43:35,908
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1518
01:43:35,941 --> 01:43:38,411
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1519
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:44,250
It's Phil.

1520
01:43:44,283 --> 01:43:46,385
He's so worried about you.

1521
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:48,887
You're texting.

1522
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,790
Finally, yeah.

1523
01:43:52,891 --> 01:43:55,261
I told him to
stay down in Florida.

1524
01:43:55,294 --> 01:43:59,331
Honey, you are gonna
love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day,

1525
01:43:59,364 --> 01:44:00,633
and we found
the cutest little house,

1526
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:02,268
and you've got
your own bathroom.

1527
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:04,403
Mom, I still want
to live in Forks.

1528
01:44:04,936 --> 01:44:06,805
What?

1529
01:44:06,838 --> 01:44:09,375
I want to live in Forks.

1530
01:44:09,408 --> 01:44:11,544
Well, okay,
but we'll talk about it.

1531
01:44:13,345 --> 01:44:15,281
Do you mind getting Dad?

1532
01:44:16,315 --> 01:44:19,585
I have to talk to him.
Apologize.

1533
01:44:19,618 --> 01:44:21,554
Okay, baby.
I'll go get him.

1534
01:44:22,854 --> 01:44:24,490
And I'll go
get a nurse, okay?

1535
01:44:24,523 --> 01:44:25,791
Okay.

1536
01:44:37,502 --> 01:44:39,471
So what happened?

1537
01:44:39,504 --> 01:44:40,806
Where's James?

1538
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,843
We took care of it.

1539
01:44:50,615 --> 01:44:52,918
And the woman,
Victoria, she ran off.

1540
01:44:53,852 --> 01:44:56,388
I'm alive because of you.

1541
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:58,624
No, you're in here
because of me.

1542
01:45:00,492 --> 01:45:02,828
The worst part of it was that

1543
01:45:04,429 --> 01:45:06,865
I thought I wasn't
gonna be able to stop.

1544
01:45:06,898 --> 01:45:08,401
You did stop.

1545
01:45:10,435 --> 01:45:14,373
Bella,
you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1546
01:45:15,907 --> 01:45:17,343
What?

1547
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:22,648
Are you... No!

1548
01:45:22,681 --> 01:45:23,683
No!

1549
01:45:25,817 --> 01:45:27,453
I don't even know
what you're... How...

1550
01:45:27,486 --> 01:45:28,954
What are you talking about?

1551
01:45:28,987 --> 01:45:30,656
You want me to go away?
I can't...

1552
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:32,858
No, I can't...
I can't just leave you...

1553
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:34,360
I know.

1554
01:45:35,994 --> 01:45:37,930
We can't be apart.

1555
01:45:37,963 --> 01:45:39,732
You can't leave me.

1556
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:41,767
I'm here.

1557
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,139
Okay, just don't...

1558
01:45:47,172 --> 01:45:49,942
You just can't say
stuff like that to me. Ever.

1559
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,949
Where else am I gonna go?

1560
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:49,835
Alice lent me the dress.

1561
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:51,170
The cast is...

1562
01:46:52,204 --> 01:46:53,839
You're perfect.

1563
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:58,911
I'll take care of her,
Chief Swan.

1564
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:01,414
Uh-huh.
I've heard that before.

1565
01:47:05,984 --> 01:47:07,653
All right, Bells.

1566
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:12,458
I put a new can of
pepper spray in your bag.

1567
01:47:12,491 --> 01:47:13,926
Dad.

1568
01:47:13,959 --> 01:47:15,194
And...

1569
01:47:17,496 --> 01:47:19,765
Well, you look beautiful.

1570
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,169
Thanks.

1571
01:47:24,903 --> 01:47:26,172
See you.

1572
01:47:33,245 --> 01:47:36,182
Hey. I'll be right back.

1573
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:38,950
Bella.

1574
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:40,653
Jacob.

1575
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,721
Hey.

1576
01:47:43,655 --> 01:47:44,657
Nice.

1577
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:46,358
You, too.

1578
01:47:46,392 --> 01:47:49,962
Are you crashing
the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1579
01:47:49,995 --> 01:47:51,230
No.

1580
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,270
My dad paid me
to come talk to you.

1581
01:47:58,303 --> 01:47:59,938
Twenty bucks.

1582
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:01,774
Let's hear it.

1583
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:04,810
Just don't get mad, okay?

1584
01:48:06,645 --> 01:48:09,681
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1585
01:48:09,714 --> 01:48:12,985
It's just, he said, quote,

1586
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:15,888
"We'll be watching you."

1587
01:48:17,856 --> 01:48:18,957
Okay, well,
tell him, "Thanks."

1588
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:20,226
Okay.

1589
01:48:20,926 --> 01:48:22,027
And to pay up.

1590
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:23,996
Okay. Let me help you.

1591
01:48:24,029 --> 01:48:24,930
Jacob.

1592
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:27,766
I'll take it from here.

1593
01:48:31,002 --> 01:48:33,239
Guess I'll see
you around, Bella.

1594
01:48:34,973 --> 01:48:36,242
All right.

1595
01:48:43,782 --> 01:48:46,919
I leave you alone
for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1596
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:55,827
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

1597
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:56,862
Just smile.

1598
01:49:03,335 --> 01:49:09,942
