1
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,570
So beautiful.

2
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,570
We're the same temperature now.



4
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,570
Hey, Bella,

5
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,570
you're a lot stronger than I am right now.



7
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,378
It's your turn not to break me.



9
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,282
I love you.

10
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,713
I love you.

11
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,027
Renesmee.



13
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,570
She's incredible.

14
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,038
Where is she? I have to see her.

15
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,433
Wait. Wait.

16
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,769
You need to get your thirst under control.

17
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,806
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.



19
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:55,688
Close your eyes.

20
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,594
What do you hear?













27
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:57,191
Bella, don't!





30
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,636
EDWARD: Bella, stop!

31
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,172
I'm sorry, I didn't realize there'd be people this far from 
the trails.



 I have to get outta here.

34
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,385
Okay, I can help you.



36
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:38,392
Or not.





39
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,394
EDWARD: (CHUCKLES) Well, I'm amazed.

40
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,262
You ran away from human blood mid-hunt.

41
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:11,728
Even mature vampires
have problems with that.



43
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,103
You're still here.

44
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:21,535
JACOB: So are you.

45
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:24,875
I didn't expect you to seem so

46
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,538
you.

47
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:30,652
Except for the creepy eyes.

48
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:34,088
I would keep my distance for now.

49
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,487
It's safer for the baby
to see how you do with me first.

50
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:39,791
Since when do you care about Renesmee?

51
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,929
All right.

52
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,332
Take a whiff.

53
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:04,085
Well, I can see
what everyone's been talking about.



55
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,988
Jake, you really do stink.



57
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:12,923
You guys

58
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,863
really look great together.

59
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,627
Want to come meet our daughter?

60
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:38,019
Welcome to the family.

61
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,116
You look amazing, Bella.

62
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,482
Someone's been waiting to meet you.

63
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:47,756
Rose.



 Beautiful.

66
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:29,863
What was that?

67
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,805
She showed you
the first memory she has of you.

68
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,143
Showed me? How?

69
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,210
How do I hear thoughts?

70
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,341
How does Alice see the future?

71
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,752
She's gifted.

72
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,756
I've only been out for two days?

73
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,925
Her growth rate is unprecedented.

74
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,993
All right. That's enough
experimenting for one day.

75
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,067
Jacob.

76
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,000
She's doing great.

77
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,204
Yeah. Let's not push it though.

78
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:06,533
What's your problem?

79
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,043
Oh.

80
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,242
Do tell her, Jacob.

81
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,709
This should be good.

82
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,374
Hold on a second.

83
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,383
Bella.

84
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,344
Look,

85
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,384
it's a wolf thing.

86
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,786
What's a wolf thing?

87
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:27,885
Um....

88
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,923
You know we have no control over it.

89
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,231
We can't choose who it happens with.

90
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:36,529
And it doesn't mean
what you think, Bella. I promise.

91
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,430
Take Renesmee out of the room.

92
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,541
Oh.

93
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:40,768
Edward, don't touch me right now.

94
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,241
I don't want to hurt you.

95
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:44,677
Oh.

96
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,419
You imprinted on my daughter?

97
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:52,953
It wasn't my choice!

98
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,077
She's a baby!

99
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:55,281
It's not like that.

100
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,085
You think Edward would let me live if it was?

101
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:58,382
I'm still debating it.

102
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,291
I've held her once!

103
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,130
One time, Jacob!

104
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,323
And already you think that you have some moronic

105
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,025
wolfy claim on her?

106
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,130
She's mine!





109
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,539
It's fine, Leah.

110
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,246
You're gonna stay away from her.

111
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:20,643
You know I can't do that.





114
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,075
Stop her, Edward.

115
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:26,916
He said it's fine.

116
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,148
She's amazing, right?

117
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,828
Do you remember how much
you wanted to be around me 3 days ago?

118
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:35,964
That's gone now, right?

119
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,065
Long gone.

120
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,292
Because it was her.

121
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,096
From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.

122
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:43,260
Nessie?

123
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,065
You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?



126
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:55,676
Seth, are you okay?

127
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:00,685
Seth, I'm sorry.



129
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,083
He'll be all right.

130
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,588
Bella,

131
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,293
you know me better than anyone.

132
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,294
All I want is for Ness....

133
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,941
Renesmee to be safe. Happy.

134
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:21,965
Look,

135
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,175
nothing ever made sense before.

136
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,973
You. Me. Any of it.

137
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,346
And now I understand why.

138
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,219
This was the reason.







142
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,974
Finally.

143
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,515
My turn.

144
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,590
Where does she sleep?

145
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,992
In my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.

146
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,765
Happy birthday.

147
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,173
I stopped aging three days ago.

148
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,705
Well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.

149
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,113
BELLA: I still hate surprises.
That hasn't changed.

150
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:44,057
ALICE: You'll love this one.

151
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,230
Welcome home!

152
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,394
We thought you guys
might like a place of your own.

153
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,064
What do you think?

154
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,866
I think it's perfect.

155
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:02,232
Go inside.

156
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:13,381
Have fun.

157
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,248
EDWARD: This will be Renesmee's room.

158
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:54,262
Closet.

159
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,156
BELLA: Wow.

160
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,299
Alice stocked it for you.

161
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,864
~ Clearly.
~ (CHUCKLES)

162
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,510
This is our room.

163
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,722
Vampires don't sleep.

164
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,187
It's not intended for sleep.





167
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,106
You really were holding back before.

168
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm never gonna get enough of this.

169
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:02,655
We don't get tired.

170
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,753
We don't have to rest
or catch our breath or eat.

171
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,763
I mean,

172
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,223
how are we gonna stop?



174
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:17,894
Rosalie and Emmett were so bad, it took a solid decade

175
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,305
before we could stand to be within five miles of them.



177
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:26,141
I think we might be worse.

178
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,746
Definitely worse.



180
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,731
EMMETT: Wow.

181
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,301
Done already?

182
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,637
Where's Renesmee?

183
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:52,304
Blondie stole her.

184
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,408
Break a lot of stuff?

185
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:58,140
BELLA: Emmett.

186
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,480
No.





189
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,320
Is that Charlie?

190
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,162
He's been calling twice a day.

191
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,591
He's in pretty rough shape.

192
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,396
CARLISLE: Eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.

193
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:28,567
He needs to mourn, Bella.

194
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:34,679
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

195
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,917
I'm gonna miss this place.

196
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,550
We'll come back. We always do.

197
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,593
Wait.

198
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,926
Nobody said anything about leaving.

199
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:52,726
Once people believe Bella's dead, we can't risk anyone seeing her.

200
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,465
So you just disappear?

201
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:58,230
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

202
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,546
Hey.

203
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:40,406
You heard anything?

204
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,547
Charlie,

205
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,154
Bella is....

206
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,591
Uh....

207
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,556
No, she's not.

208
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,221
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine.

209
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:57,593
She's back home and

210
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,297
she's feeling better.

211
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,066
Why didn't you say so? That's great.

212
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,073
Wait.

213
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,303
There's something you need to see first.

214
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,006
I need to see Bella.

215
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,611
Look,

216
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:17,679
in order for Bella to get better, she had to

217
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:22,087
change.

218
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:24,923
What do you mean, "change"?

219
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,828
Here goes nothing.

220
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,265
What the hell are you doing?

221
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,663
You don't live in the world you think you do.

222
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,199
Jacob, put your clothes on.

223
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,143
JACOB: Now, this may seem strange.

224
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:49,143
Really strange. But

225
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,687
stranger things happen every day.

226
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:54,522
Trust me.

227
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,759
Holy shit! (GRUNTS)



229
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:10,799
JACOB: Look, I solved a problem.

230
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:12,665
You were leaving.

231
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,274
What did you expect me to do?

232
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,309
You don't realize
the danger you've put him in.

233
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,776
The Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.

234
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,973
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

235
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:22,777
I only said you were different.

236
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:25,045
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

237
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,620
I mean, seriously, Jake,
he's not just gonna let that go.

238
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,156
Did you consider
the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

239
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,385
It'll be like sticking
a white hot branding iron down her throat.

240
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,496
And that's assuming
she can control her thirst.

241
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:37,222
JACOB: Look, Charlie's been in hell.

242
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,864
And I know you'll be
much happier with him in your life.

243
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,503
Jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this for anyone 
but yourself.

244
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:45,834
Sorry you feel that way

245
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:48,375
because he'll be here in 10 minutes.

246
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:49,532
What?

247
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:51,542
ALICE: These will irritate your eyes at first.

248
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,646
The main thing is not to move too fast.

249
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,747
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

250
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,990
Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.

251
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,531
And blink at least three times a minute.

252
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,204
Good.

253
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,337
For a cartoon character.

254
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:21,633
Hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.

255
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:25,847
Just don't forget to move your shoulders so it looks like 
you're breathing.

256
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,651
ROSALIE: And don't sit so straight.

257
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,144
Humans don't do that.

258
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,149
Okay. I got it.

259
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,224
Move around, blink, slouch.



261
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,204
Good luck.

262
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,951
Hello, Charlie.

263
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:16,886
Where's Bella?

264
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,161
Bella.

265
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:48,554
Hi, Dad.

266
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:54,294
Are you okay?

267
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,132
Never better.

268
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,765
Healthy as a horse.

269
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:08,509
You don't turn into an animal, too, do you?

270
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,521
She wishes she was that awesome.

271
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,155
Let's give them some privacy.

272
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,176
Uh, Jake said that this....

273
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,009
This was necessary.

274
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:41,375
What does that mean?

275
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:44,583
I really think it would be better....

276
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,380
I wanna know what happened to you.

277
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,714
I can't tell you.

278
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,657
I think I deserve an explanation.

279
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:51,759
You do.

280
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:55,930
But if you really need one, I can't stay here.

281
00:25:56,197 --> 00:25:57,528
Oh, come on! No!

282
00:25:57,632 --> 00:25:59,031
No more going away!

283
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,165
Dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason,

284
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,038
I'm all right.

285
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,732
I'm more than all right.

286
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:07,670
Can you live with that?

287
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,675
Can I live with that?

288
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:13,912
Well, I don't know, Bella.

289
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,107
I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life

290
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,243
turn into a very large dog.

291
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,046
My daughter looks like my daughter.

292
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,415
But doesn't.

293
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,863
Can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that 
you need to know?

294
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,427
And I don't need to know this?

295
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:37,405
No.

296
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,234
Really, you don't.

297
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,073
Well....

298
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,582
Not gonna lose you again.

299
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,450
I can't.

300
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:55,750
Then you won't.

301
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,585
I promise.

302
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:17,775
I missed you, Bells.

303
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:20,638
So much.

304
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:24,745
I missed you, Dad.

305
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,658
Charlie.

306
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,192
This is Renesmee.

307
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:41,726
Your niece?

308
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:44,998
Our daughter.

309
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,344
Right.

310
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,005
The adoption.

311
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,516
Renee-semee?

312
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,082
She's got your eyes, Bella.

313
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,265
Need to know, I guess.

314
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:31,945
JASPER: Well done, Bella.

315
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,515
Never seen a newborn
show that kind of restraint.

316
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:37,388
I'm not sure she is a newborn.

317
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,623
She's so tame.

318
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:42,624
EDWARD: Emmett, don't antagonize her.

319
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,753
She's the strongest one in the house.

320
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,831
~ (SNORTS) Please.
~ (KNUCKLES CRACKING)

321
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,534
Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.

322
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,871
JASPER: All right. On 3.

323
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,611
1,

324
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:02,881
2,

325
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,048
~ 3!
~ (EMMETT GRUNTING)



327
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:22,593
Did you see that?



329
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,274
Thank you.

330
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,102
BELLA: My time as a human was over.

331
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,772
But I never felt more alive.

332
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:02,536
I was born to be a vampire.

333
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:19,818
Everything was falling into place.

334
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,065
Even the Volturi
seemed to accept my new status.

335
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,201
Though they'd want proof eventually.

336
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:33,938
It seemed we had only one enemy left.

337
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,477
Time.

338
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,841
Renesmee was growing too fast.

339
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:46,985
We all worried about
how long we would have with her.

340
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:50,688
It just made every moment more precious.

341
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,826
RENESMEE: Look, a snowflake.

342
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:54,719
It's beautiful.

343
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,757
Why don't you go get another one?

344
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:04,063
Edward thinks that
we'll find answers in Brazil.

345
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,705
There are tribes there
that might know something.

346
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:25,649
RENESMEE: Who was that?

347
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:29,228
I think that's our cousin from Denali.



349
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:34,660
Irina!

350
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:00,259
Tanya convinced lrina
to come reconcile with us.

351
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,022
It looks like she changed her mind.

352
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,495
Seeing Jacob
must have been too much for her.

353
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:06,529
Wish I could have just spoken to her.

354
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,999
She's family. She'll come around.







358
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,468
What a pleasant surprise.

359
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,440
What do you want?

360
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:28,907
Hmm?

361
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:35,050
I have to report a crime.

362
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:38,885
The Cullens....

363
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,896
They've done something terrible.

364
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,463
Allow me, my dear.

365
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,548
Oh, my.

366
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:14,487
(PLAYING EDWARD'S TUNE)

367
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:41,981
What is it, Alice?

368
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,148
The Volturi.

369
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:46,919
They're coming for us.

370
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:51,925
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.

371
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,133
And lrina.

372
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:54,334
Honey, come here.

373
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:58,001
Why?

374
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,231
What did lrina see in the woods?

375
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,637
We were just walking.

376
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,867
Ness was catching snowflakes.

377
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,875
Of course.

378
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:13,883
Irina thinks Renesmee's an immortal Child.

379
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:19,285
CARLISLE: The immortal Children
were very beautiful.

380
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:20,752
So enchanting.

381
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:22,896
To be near them was to love them.

382
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,659
But their development was frozen at the age they were turned.

383
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,594
They couldn't be taught or restrained.

384
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:32,733
A single tantrum
could destroy an entire village.



386
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,407
Humans heard about the devastation.

387
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:43,809
Stories spread.

388
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,315
The Volturi were forced to intervene.

389
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,956
Since the Children
couldn't protect our secret,

390
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:55,356
they had to be destroyed.



392
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:04,371
WOMAN: No!

 No!

394
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,607
No!



396
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,509
CARLISLE: Their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them.



398
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:19,219
Long-established covens were torn apart.

399
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:21,781
Countless humans slaughtered.

400
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:26,122
Traditions, friends,

401
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,361
even families. Lost.

402
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:30,224
WOMAN: No, no!

403
00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:31,456
~ Mother!
~ WOMAN: No!

404
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:32,964
Mother!





407
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,565
So the Denalis' mother
made an immortal Child?

408
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:41,842
CARLISLE: Yes.

409
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:44,176
And she paid the price.



411
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,835
Well, Renesmee's nothing like those children.

412
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:13,440
She was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.

413
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,575
So can't you just explain that to the Volturi?

414
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,938
Aro has enough proof in lrina's thoughts.

415
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,108
So we fight.

416
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,378
JASPER: Their offensive
weapons are too powerful.

417
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:28,578
No one can stand against Jane.

418
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,719
Alec's even worse.

419
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,583
Well, then we convince them.

420
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:35,057
They're coming to kill us, not to talk.

421
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:36,896
No, you're right.

422
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:38,591
They won't listen to us.

423
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,732
But maybe others can convince them.

424
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,736
Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.

425
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:45,235
I won't ask them to fight.

426
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,704
Not fight. Witness.

427
00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:49,242
If enough people knew the truth,

428
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:51,436
maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.

429
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,808
We can ask this of our friends.

430
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,819
At least we get to go to London again.

431
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,023
We haven't been there in a long time.

432
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,167
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

433
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:21,572
SAM: Alice asked me to give you that.

434
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,937
She and Jasper
crossed our lands to the ocean last night.

435
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:28,005
Carlisle?

436
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:30,811
They've left us.

437
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:32,474
Why?

438
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,180
She didn't say.

439
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,447
Can I see that?

440
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:49,132
ALICE: Gather as many witnesses as you can before the snow sticks to 
the ground.

441
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:50,965
That's when they'll come.

442
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:57,171
BELLA: Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained.

443
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:01,280
Why would she and Jasper leave at the moment we needed them most?

444
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:03,005
What did they know?

445
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,483
Our search for witnesses began with a trip north to our 
closest relatives.

446
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:45,992
TANYA: Edward, is everything all right?

447
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:49,055
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

448
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:51,822
CARMEN: Is it lrina?

449
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,400
Have you heard from her?

450
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,693
Not directly.

451
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,032
Why is your bride waiting in the car?

452
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:58,770
KATE: And why have you brought
a wolf with you?

453
00:39:58,873 --> 00:39:59,999
I can smell him from here.

454
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,372
My family is in danger. I need your help.

455
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:03,601
What's happened?

456
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:05,879
It's hard to explain

457
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,777
but I need you to be open-minded. Can you do that?

458
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,377
Of course.

459
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:15,846
Okay.

460
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:17,956
Time to meet some new people.

461
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,354
What if they don't like me?

462
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,059
~ They'll love you.
~ They will.

463
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:23,390
Once they understand you.

464
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:25,691
They just haven't met anyone like you before.

465
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:31,393
Okay.



467
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,239
The Volturi will come for all of us.

468
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:45,082
You get that thing out of here.

469
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:46,311
She's not what she looks like.

470
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,682
This is a crime!





473
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,097
Stay back!

474
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,167
She has blood in her veins.

475
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:04,033
You can feel her warmth.

476
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:05,530
I can feel it.

477
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,197
I'm her biological father.

478
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,775
~ Bella is her mother.
~ Impossible.

479
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,504
It's true. She was born
while I was still human.

480
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:14,079
I've never heard of such a thing.

481
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:15,545
She can show you, if you let her.

482
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:22,122
Tanya, you owe us this much.

483
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:25,926
We're all under a death sentence because your sister didn't 
let us explain.

484
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:35,268
BELLA: Don't be afraid.

485
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:38,737
This is how she communicates.

486
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,412
It's true.

487
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,481
She's not immortal.

488
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:05,293
BELLA: I knew the rest of our family
would face this fear as well.

489
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:08,892
Fear of the unknown.

490
00:42:11,138 --> 00:42:12,298
Fear of the Volturi.

491
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,274
CARLISLE: Amun, please!

492
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:24,109
I cannot help you, Carlisle.

493
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:25,615
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.

494
00:42:25,853 --> 00:42:26,979
You must go.

495
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,931
I'd like to hear about it.

496
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,797
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.

497
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:46,439
He likes to keep me hidden.

498
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,972
I can't imagine why.

499
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:05,086
~ Carlisle.
~ Benjamin.

500
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,513
EDWARD: Benjamin can
influence the elements.

501
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:35,517
And here I get super self-control.



503
00:44:00,881 --> 00:44:01,870
Who are they?

504
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,281
Senna and Zafrina.

505
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:06,113
From the Amazon.

506
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,721
BELLA: The arrival of Senna and Zafrina meant that our plea was 
being heard

507
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:20,959
in even the most remote corners of the world

508
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:22,959
while others searched for witnesses closer to home.



510
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,910
BELLA: A patriot Carlisle first met
on the battlefield at Yorktown

511
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,070
would become our most unlikely ally.



513
00:44:36,617 --> 00:44:38,744
Shut up!

514
00:44:41,188 --> 00:44:43,850
I hated the first British invasion.

515
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,755
And I hate the second one even more.

516
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:48,420
EMMETT: Even the Beatles?

517
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:50,520
Really, Garrett?

518
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:53,726
Old habits die hard.

519
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:56,261
~ Carlisle needs you.
~ (GROANS)



521
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,034
Sounds interesting.

522
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,265
MAN: Help!

523
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,309
But first I'd better finish my meal.

524
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,372
Help me! Help!





527
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:17,347
BELLA: Each of them was won over.

528
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:18,822
Each was made to see.

529
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:28,965
Carlisle convinced his Irish friends to make the journey to Forks.

530
00:45:30,804 --> 00:45:32,795
Although we were grateful for their help,

531
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,670
their thirst for human blood complicated the situation.

532
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:44,648
The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable.

533
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:47,581
Especially Peter

534
00:45:47,688 --> 00:45:49,986
who had fought alongside
Jasper as a newborn.

535
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:53,789
Lotta red eyes around here.

536
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:55,794
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

537
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,257
But they'll feed somewhere.

538
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,530
BELLA: As more vampires
set foot in their territory,

539
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,663
more Quileutes turned.

540
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,167
Their nature compelling them to join the pack.



542
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:14,442
Hey, easy there. Hey!

543
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:15,947
~ (WHINING)
~ It's all right.

544
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,840
You're gonna be okay.



546
00:46:21,421 --> 00:46:24,618
BELLA: Finally, Carlisle and Esme
returned with our last witness.

547
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:29,487
~ How many came?
~ EDWARD: Eighteen.

548
00:46:29,897 --> 00:46:31,228
You have some good friends.

549
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:32,632
And Alice?

550
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,632
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

551
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,200
Centuries on the run.
That's what you've brought me.

552
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,308
Some friend, Carlisle.

553
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,407
Alistair, come meet everyone.

554
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:48,008
I already told you, if it comes to a fight, I won't stand against 
the Volturi.

555
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,514
It won't come to a fight.

556
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:52,843
I'll be in the attic.

557
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,893
He's not a people person.

558
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:07,199
BELLA: We opened our home to 18 vampires.

559
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,233
Many with gifts of their own.

560
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,272
Zafrina had power over the mind.

561
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:17,508
She could make anyone see what she wanted them to.

562
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,799
If she weren't holding my hand right now, I could swear this was real.

563
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:48,202
I don't see anything.

564
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,472
ELEAZAR: Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

565
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,547
What's a shield?

566
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:01,249
The ones I've met are so different.

567
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:03,320
It's a defensive talent.

568
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,221
It's why I couldn't read your mind, even before.

569
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:07,821
It's why Aro couldn't.

570
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:09,622
You have a very powerful gift.



572
00:48:10,998 --> 00:48:12,727
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

573
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,664
Shoulda put her on her ass.

574
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,960
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

575
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,337
Maybe it only works on the weak.

576
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:25,240
Garrett, I wouldn't.

578
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,519
You are an amazing woman.

579
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,351
JACOB: Now, you guys can do some serious damage.

580
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:42,359
Which is why you'll need
to control your phasing.

581
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:47,329
If your mom pisses you off, you don't want to tear her head off.

582
00:48:57,244 --> 00:48:59,109
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.





 Whoopa!





588
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:53,857
CARLISLE: Vladimir, Stefan,

589
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:55,934
you're a long way from home.

590
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:57,961
What are they doing here?

591
00:49:58,105 --> 00:50:00,539
We heard the Volturi
were moving against you.

592
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,365
But that you would not stand alone.

593
00:50:02,976 --> 00:50:04,534
We didn't do what we were accused of.

594
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:07,442
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

595
00:50:07,614 --> 00:50:09,741
We have been waiting a millennium

596
00:50:10,183 --> 00:50:13,744
for the ltalian scum to be challenged.

597
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:16,481
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

598
00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:17,885
Shame.

599
00:50:18,492 --> 00:50:21,086
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

600
00:50:21,328 --> 00:50:23,762
They enjoy a good fight. (CHUCKLES)

601
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:27,228
Aro's witnesses?

602
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:28,323
VLADIMIR: Aww.

603
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:30,465
Still hoping they'll listen?

604
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:34,973
ELEAZAR: When Aro wants someone 
from a coven

605
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:39,101
it's never long before evidence turns up proving that coven 
committed some crime.

606
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:40,577
So he's done this before?

607
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:43,975
It happens so rarely,
I never realized it was a pattern.

608
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:47,848
Apparently he always pardons one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

609
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:50,089
This person always has an ability.

610
00:50:50,557 --> 00:50:52,684
And they're always given
a place with the Guard.

611
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,258
This is all about Alice.

612
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:57,329
~ He has no one like her.
~ Which is why she left.

613
00:50:57,497 --> 00:50:58,828
Why does he need witnesses?

614
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:01,490
To spread the word
that justice has been served.

615
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:04,362
After he slaughters an entire coven.

616
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:10,035
AMUN: Benjamin, Tia,

617
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:12,202
~ we're leaving.
~ And where will you go?

618
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:14,873
What makes you think
they'll be satisfied with Alice?

619
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:17,809
What's to stop them
from going after Benjamin next?

620
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:19,042
Or Zafrina or Kate

621
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,880
or anyone else with a gift? Anyone they want.

622
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,652
Their goal isn't punishment, it's power.

623
00:51:23,023 --> 00:51:24,285
It's acquisition.

624
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:26,784
Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will.

625
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:30,125
For the sake of my family. But also for yours.

626
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:32,823
And for the way you want to live.

627
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:42,400
The packs will fight.

628
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,444
We've never been afraid of vampires.

629
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:48,539
We will fight.

630
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,083
GARRETT: This won't be the first time
I fought a king's rule.

631
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,415
We'll join you.

632
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:55,555
No.

633
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:58,754
I will do the right thing, Amun.

634
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:00,787
You may do as you please.

635
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:05,088
We will stand with you.

636
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,522
So will we.

637
00:52:10,904 --> 00:52:12,633
That didn't take much.

638
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,368
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

639
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:17,035
We'll see.

640
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:27,951
BELLA: Everyone showed courage.

641
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:31,081
Though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us.

642
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:35,159
Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.

643
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:38,223
And worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec

644
00:52:39,432 --> 00:52:41,923
who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.







648
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:00,851
I refused him!

649
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:02,852
I'm not with Carlisle!

650
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:12,323
Alec?

651
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:35,152
I will never go against you.

652
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:37,079
Of course not,

653
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:40,553
my dear Toshiro.

654
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:02,375
It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.



656
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:14,827
Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.



658
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,388
Sad,

659
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:19,559
isn't it?

660
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,528
EDWARD: Aro will want us incapacitated
before he attacks.

661
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:27,700
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first because I can 
anticipate their moves.

662
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,365
Too bad we don't all have your shield.

663
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,734
Doesn't help me fight, though.

664
00:54:31,911 --> 00:54:32,935
TANYA: No, but you could help the rest of us,

665
00:54:33,113 --> 00:54:34,239
if you could project it.

666
00:54:34,414 --> 00:54:35,540
What do you mean?

667
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,081
I mean shield someone other than yourself.

668
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:38,241
Is that possible?

669
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:40,353
Gifts can be developed. Over time.

670
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:42,250
At first, mine was just in my palms.

671
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:44,713
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

672
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:46,825
~ How do you do it?
~ (SIGHS)

673
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,728
~ Tell me.
~ Ow.

674
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,463
You need to visualize it.

675
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,232
See how it moves.

676
00:54:57,237 --> 00:54:58,431
What color it is.

677
00:54:59,873 --> 00:55:01,568
Now picture it expanding.

678
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,636
Will it to go beyond you.



680
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,825
I think she needs something to motivate her.

681
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,992
~ No.
~ It's all right, I can take it.

682
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:29,430
He says that now.

683
00:55:29,669 --> 00:55:32,160
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

684
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:36,438
~ Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.
~ (CRACKLING)



686
00:55:38,478 --> 00:55:39,945
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

687
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:41,914
Dude, you're not motivating her.

688
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:42,982
You want to try?

690
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,361
Kate!

691
00:55:55,962 --> 00:55:57,486
KATE: You seem to lack incentive.

692
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,325
Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?

693
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,822
Are you crazy?

694
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:03,335
All right.

695
00:56:03,503 --> 00:56:05,061
This one's on full power.





698
00:56:39,672 --> 00:56:41,663
It's painful, but it's bearable.

699
00:56:48,147 --> 00:56:49,205
Okay, we should go again.

700
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,317
Emmett.

701
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:53,652
I'm good.

702
00:56:54,654 --> 00:56:56,121
BELLA: "There's sweet music here that

703
00:56:56,256 --> 00:57:00,625
"softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass.

704
00:57:01,928 --> 00:57:04,954
"Or night dews on still waters between walls

705
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:08,299
"of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass.

706
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,870
"Music that brings
sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."

707
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:30,013
Mom.

708
00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:31,524
Hmm?

709
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:34,726
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away

710
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:36,855
because we're gonna die?

711
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:43,357
No.

712
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:49,504
I think they left to keep us safer.

713
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,574
That's what all these
other people are here for, too.

714
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:56,077
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

715
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:04,885
Come here. Go to sleep.

716
00:58:25,078 --> 00:58:26,443
It's strange.

717
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,545
Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.

718
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,718
Mentally, I just feel drained.

719
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:39,651
How about a bath?

720
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,577
I do remember how to undress myself.

721
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:04,350
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

722
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,517
Bella,

723
00:59:16,129 --> 00:59:18,996
I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.

724
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:23,831
Every obstacle you've faced,

725
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:27,103
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

726
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,871
And you just did.

727
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,842
You're the reason
they have something to fight for.

728
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:38,180
My family.

729
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:56,601
I'm gonna get the water running.

730
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:32,794
BELLA: Alice made sure
only I would get the message.

731
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,971
Because only my mind
would be safe from Aro.

732
01:00:43,783 --> 01:00:45,910
JACOB: I'm surprised you took 
a break from Jedi training.

733
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:49,788
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad, he'll come to us.

734
01:00:51,157 --> 01:00:53,455
27 vampires, one human.

735
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:55,521
Not so great.

736
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:58,429
I know that's what you told Edward.

737
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,328
~ (EXHALES)
~ Whatever.

738
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,503
I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.



740
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:12,611
I'm sorry.

741
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,304
I know.

742
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,306
They're the good guys.

743
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:19,051
But come on,

744
01:01:19,418 --> 01:01:21,477
Dracula One and Two are

745
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:26,516
~ creepy.
~ (BOTH LAUGHING)

746
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:41,464
CHARLIE: There she is. Come here.

747
01:01:41,774 --> 01:01:42,934
Oh!

748
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,502
Wow! Look at you.

749
01:01:45,878 --> 01:01:47,038
You've grown half a foot!

750
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,847
Seriously.

751
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,742
Like 6 inches.

752
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:53,813
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

753
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,251
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

754
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:58,251
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

755
01:01:58,357 --> 01:01:59,654
I'll be back soon, okay?

756
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:03,658
~ CHARLIE: Come on. Let's go.
~ (RENESMEE LAUGHS)



758
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:13,563
BELLA: Alice's note gave me a 
new sense of hope.

759
01:02:14,574 --> 01:02:16,565
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

760
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:23,627
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

761
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,865
BELLA: I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.
HOST: Right this way.

762
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:50,075
~ JENKS: Mrs. Cullen.
~ Hi.

763
01:02:50,543 --> 01:02:52,010
I'm so happy you called.

764
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:08,049
I always meet my private clients here.

765
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,185
It's more comfortable than the office.

766
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,329
And it's more public.

767
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,564
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

768
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,361
What type of work do you do, J.?

769
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,260
Oh, you know, this and that.

770
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:21,766
It's always different,
which keeps it interesting.

771
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,703
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

772
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:30,245
I've been working with them for more than 20 years.

773
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:34,251
And my late partner
knew Jasper 15 years before that.

774
01:03:34,388 --> 01:03:35,548
He is, uh,

775
01:03:37,224 --> 01:03:39,249
unusually well-preserved.

776
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,626
Yes, he is.

777
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:49,864
I trust that Mr. Jasper
is enjoying his vacation.

778
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:53,566
He didn't tell you where he was going, did he?

779
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,766
No, no, no,
he just mentioned that he was leaving

780
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,901
when he came by to place his order.

781
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:02,946
I assume that his order is ready?

782
01:04:03,116 --> 01:04:04,276
Of course.

783
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:07,086
I've never been late with a delivery.

784
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:27,763
There a problem?

785
01:04:30,277 --> 01:04:31,244
No.

786
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:36,477
My husband and I thought
that we'd all be traveling together.

787
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,447
Jasper said only two were traveling.

788
01:04:38,685 --> 01:04:40,152
His instructions were very clear.

789
01:04:40,454 --> 01:04:41,614
It's my mistake.

790
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:46,422
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

791
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:09,783
BELLA: Alice's vision was clear.

792
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:15,621
Renesmee would have a future.

793
01:05:17,558 --> 01:05:19,458
But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.

794
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,297
How ya doin'?



796
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,420
BELLA: "My dearest Renesmee,

797
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,055
"I thought we would have forever together.

798
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,028
"But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped.

799
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:57,054
"I know now why Alice left me clues.

800
01:05:57,732 --> 01:05:58,994
"It was to keep you safe.

801
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:03,001
"Everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack.

802
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:06,335
"Jacob will protect you.

803
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:09,008
"And he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends. "

804
01:06:13,114 --> 01:06:14,672
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

805
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:18,350
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

806
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:23,182
I must admit, you even had me believing.

807
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,050
For a moment.



809
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:30,295
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

810
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:35,969
Cheers.

811
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:47,243
The snow is sticking.

812
01:06:48,183 --> 01:06:49,309
Hey, we still have today.

813
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:59,257
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.

814
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:01,494
Bella, no one's giving up here.

815
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:06,090
All right! Present time! Let's go!

816
01:07:06,802 --> 01:07:08,133
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

817
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:11,438
Jake, you start. Get it going.

818
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:14,502
SETH: What did you get me?
LEAH: I'm not giving you anything.

819
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:16,637
SETH: Hey! No, come on,
what did you get me?

820
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:18,211
BELLA: Well, Dad, we didn't 
have time to wrap yours,

821
01:07:18,313 --> 01:07:19,439
but here it is.

822
01:07:25,187 --> 01:07:27,553
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

823
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:28,982
It's for you and Sue.

824
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:30,787
You leave tomorrow.

825
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,560
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

826
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:35,724
Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.

827
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:37,793
I made arrangements for you at work.

828
01:07:39,334 --> 01:07:40,392
Sneaky.

829
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,537
And extravagant.

830
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:46,134
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

831
01:07:48,076 --> 01:07:49,475
You two trying to get rid of me?

832
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:54,173
Because it's working! (CHUCKLES)

833
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,714
Fraser River.
That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

834
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,317
SUE: We might even hook
a Rainbow or some Bulls.

835
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:02,917
Woman knows her trout.

836
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,188
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

837
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:09,425
Jacob make this for you?

838
01:08:10,432 --> 01:08:11,399
Wanna put it on?

839
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:17,733
It's so pretty.

840
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:19,705
It is really pretty.

841
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,355
That's what I'm talkin' about.

842
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:46,431
A little pre-battle bonfire.

843
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:50,803
Telling war stories.

844
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:56,474
Or just standing there like frickin' statues.

845
01:08:59,082 --> 01:09:01,983
Name any American battle. I was there.

846
01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:05,880
Little Bighorn.

847
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:10,158
I came this close to biting Custer.

848
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:12,056
But the lndians got him first.

849
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:16,264
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

850
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,797
He didn't win that one on his own.

851
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:20,197
LIAM: If you're talking battles,

852
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:21,463
you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

853
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:24,462
No one does rebellion like the lrish.

854
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,336
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

855
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:29,138
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

856
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:32,713
VLADIMIR: When we ruled,
everything came to us.

857
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:34,173
Prey,

858
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:35,441
diplomats,

859
01:09:36,019 --> 01:09:37,111
favor seekers.

860
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:39,715
Such was our power.

861
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:43,984
But we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.

862
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,721
We were honest about what we were.

863
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:51,058
VLADIMIR: We sat still for a very long time.

864
01:09:52,336 --> 01:09:55,066
We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.

865
01:09:57,274 --> 01:10:00,368
Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they

866
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:03,041
burned our castles.

867
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,308
We've been waiting 1,500 years

868
01:10:07,084 --> 01:10:08,574
to return that favor.

869
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:14,319
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

870
01:10:16,193 --> 01:10:17,717
EDWARD: I can't help thinking,

871
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,385
all these people
are putting themselves in danger

872
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:21,088
because I fell in love with a human.

873
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:22,562
CARLISLE: You found your mate.

874
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,064
You deserve to be happy.

875
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:26,702
But at what cost?

876
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:28,533
Everyone here has something to fight for.

877
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:30,032
I certainly do.

878
01:10:41,885 --> 01:10:43,284
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

879
01:10:46,423 --> 01:10:48,084
For this extraordinary life.

880
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:08,408
This means "More than my own life."

881
01:11:08,512 --> 01:11:09,877
That's how much I love you.

882
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:13,541
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob.

883
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:16,647
No matter what.

884
01:11:17,988 --> 01:11:19,546
Even if I tell him that....

885
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:23,316
That he has to take you somewhere.

886
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:27,561
Hey.

887
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:28,791
Baby, it's all right.

888
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:31,734
You're gonna be safe.

889
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,632
Always.

890
01:12:22,353 --> 01:12:24,014
If we live through this,

891
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,317
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

892
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:32,192
Now you tell me.

893
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:50,914
The Redcoats are coming!
The Redcoats are coming!

894
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,719
Aro's looking for Alice.









899
01:14:27,313 --> 01:14:28,575
CARLISLE: Aro,

900
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:30,808
let us discuss things as we used to.

901
01:14:30,983 --> 01:14:32,280
In a civilized manner.

902
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:34,415
Fair words, Carlisle.

903
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:36,920
But a little out of place,

904
01:14:37,023 --> 01:14:39,856
given the battalion
you've assembled against us.

905
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,954
I can promise you, that was never my intent.

906
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,325
No laws have been broken.

907
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:46,958
We see the child.

908
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,730
Do not treat us as fools.

909
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:51,837
She is not an immortal!

910
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:56,306
These witnesses can attest to that.

911
01:14:57,844 --> 01:14:59,175
Or you can look.

912
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,473
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

913
01:15:02,616 --> 01:15:03,583
Artifice!

914
01:15:03,984 --> 01:15:07,351
I will collect every facet of the truth.

915
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:11,585
But from someone more central to the story.

916
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:13,617
Edward,

917
01:15:14,661 --> 01:15:18,119
as the child clings to your newborn mate,

918
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:22,793
I assume you are involved.

919
01:16:36,477 --> 01:16:38,172
I'd like to meet her.



921
01:17:31,432 --> 01:17:32,899
Ah.

922
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:35,531
Young Bella.

923
01:17:37,638 --> 01:17:40,004
Immortality becomes you.





926
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:50,876
I hear her strange heart.



928
01:18:11,706 --> 01:18:12,832
Hello, Aro.

929
01:18:31,259 --> 01:18:32,692
Magnifico!

930
01:18:38,533 --> 01:18:40,194
Half mortal,

931
01:18:40,769 --> 01:18:42,896
half immortal.

932
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:46,536
Conceived and carried by this

933
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:48,401
newborn

934
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:51,541
while she was still human.

935
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,106
Impossible!

936
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:57,382
Do you think they fooled me, brother?



938
01:19:05,827 --> 01:19:07,727
Bring the informer forward.

939
01:19:21,811 --> 01:19:23,904
Is that the child you saw?

940
01:19:29,318 --> 01:19:30,342
I'm not sure.

941
01:19:30,486 --> 01:19:31,817
Jane.

942
01:19:31,954 --> 01:19:34,787
She's changed. This child is bigger.

943
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:37,122
Then your allegations were false.

944
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,024
The Cullens are innocent.

945
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:42,323
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

946
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:47,627
I'm sorry.

947
01:19:53,676 --> 01:19:54,665
Caius, no!

948
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:57,446
Irina!







953
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:11,960
Blind them.

954
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:19,729
Give me my sight back.

955
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:21,468
Tanya, this is what they want.

956
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:23,003
If you attack now, we'll all die.

957
01:20:45,594 --> 01:20:47,357
~ Pain.
~ (GRUNTING IN PAIN)

958
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:23,925
It's working.



960
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,929
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.

961
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:01,493
Agreed.

962
01:22:03,206 --> 01:22:05,367
But does it then follow

963
01:22:05,809 --> 01:22:07,800
that there is no danger?

964
01:22:11,915 --> 01:22:14,645
For the first time in our history

965
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:19,451
humans pose a threat

966
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,513
to our kind.

967
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:24,493
Their modern technology

968
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:28,290
has given birth to weapons that could destroy us.

969
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:33,168
Maintaining our secret

970
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:35,972
has never been more imperative.

971
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:41,207
In such perilous times,

972
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,477
only the known

973
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:46,544
is safe.

974
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:49,652
Only the known

975
01:22:50,188 --> 01:22:51,712
is tolerable.

976
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:53,983
And we know nothing

977
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,958
of what this child will become.

978
01:22:59,497 --> 01:23:02,728
Can we live with such uncertainty?

979
01:23:05,603 --> 01:23:08,231
Spare ourselves a fight today,

980
01:23:10,341 --> 01:23:12,036
only to die

981
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:15,145
~ tomorrow.
~ (ALL CHATTERING)

982
01:23:15,246 --> 01:23:16,213
No.



984
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:29,893
Alice.

985
01:23:30,695 --> 01:23:31,684
Alice!

986
01:23:47,044 --> 01:23:49,035
ARO: My dear, dear Alice,

987
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:52,746
we're so glad to see you here, after all.

988
01:23:52,884 --> 01:23:55,785
I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.

989
01:23:57,722 --> 01:23:58,882
Let me show you.

990
01:23:59,657 --> 01:24:00,624
Brother?



992
01:24:26,585 --> 01:24:28,416
It doesn't matter what I show you.

993
01:24:30,422 --> 01:24:31,719
Even when you see.

994
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:35,524
You still won't change your decision.

995
01:24:36,662 --> 01:24:37,720
Now!

996
01:24:48,907 --> 01:24:50,306
Take care of my daughter.

997
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:57,239
Get them.

998
01:25:15,867 --> 01:25:17,095
Hmm!

999
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:26,275
Take her away.

1000
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:29,844
Let her go!





























1015
01:28:54,289 --> 01:28:55,278
RENESMEE: Jacob!

1016
01:28:56,357 --> 01:28:57,984
~ Jacob!
~ (WHIMPERING)

1017
01:28:58,126 --> 01:28:59,115
Jacob!

1018
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:01,252
Jacob!



1020
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:06,534
Watch out!





 Bella!









1028
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:13,020
Finally.

1029
01:34:05,369 --> 01:34:06,529
Now you know.

1030
01:34:07,538 --> 01:34:08,869
That's your future.

1031
01:34:10,074 --> 01:34:12,338
Unless you decide on another course.

1032
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:16,243
We cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.

1033
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:18,007
EDWARD: But what if you were sure she could

1034
01:34:18,115 --> 01:34:19,878
remain concealed from the human world?

1035
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:21,975
Could we leave in peace?

1036
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:24,145
Of course. But that cannot be known.

1037
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:26,420
Actually, it can.

1038
01:35:04,929 --> 01:35:07,329
I've been searching for witnesses of my own

1039
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:09,400
among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

1040
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,593
~ We have enough witnesses.
~ Let him speak, brother.

1041
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:14,399
I am half human,

1042
01:35:15,207 --> 01:35:16,401
half vampire.

1043
01:35:17,475 --> 01:35:18,533
Like the child.

1044
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:21,708
A vampire seduced my mother,

1045
01:35:22,147 --> 01:35:23,910
who died giving birth to me.

1046
01:35:24,249 --> 01:35:25,409
My aunt Huilen

1047
01:35:26,718 --> 01:35:28,049
raised me as her own.

1048
01:35:30,055 --> 01:35:31,386
I made her immortal.

1049
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:34,424
How old are you?

1050
01:35:37,896 --> 01:35:39,796
150 years.

1051
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:43,932
At what age did you reach maturity?

1052
01:35:44,236 --> 01:35:47,603
I became full-grown
seven years after my birth.

1053
01:35:49,007 --> 01:35:50,406
I have not changed since then.

1054
01:35:55,647 --> 01:35:57,205
And your diet?

1055
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:58,542
Blood,

1056
01:35:58,650 --> 01:35:59,708
human food.

1057
01:36:00,819 --> 01:36:02,218
I can survive on either.

1058
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:06,755
These children are much like us.

1059
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:09,992
Regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves.

1060
01:36:10,095 --> 01:36:11,528
Our natural enemies.

1061
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:25,701
Dear ones,

1062
01:36:27,612 --> 01:36:29,910
there is no danger here.

1063
01:36:32,017 --> 01:36:33,609
We will not fight

1064
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:35,108
today.

1065
01:37:03,215 --> 01:37:04,978
Such a prize.

1066
01:37:09,322 --> 01:37:12,314
We have them on the run.
Now is the time to attack.

1067
01:37:12,558 --> 01:37:13,650
Not today.

1068
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:18,653
You're all fools!

1069
01:37:18,965 --> 01:37:20,489
The Volturi might be gone.

1070
01:37:21,033 --> 01:37:22,830
But they will never forgive

1071
01:37:23,402 --> 01:37:24,699
what happened here.







1075
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:24,428
You have a beautiful family.

1076
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,534
She's gonna be around
for a long time, isn't she?

1077
01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:38,501
A very long time.

1078
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:42,843
I'm glad she has you.

1079
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:53,386
So should I start calling you "Dad"?

1080
01:38:55,228 --> 01:38:56,195
No.

1081
01:38:58,865 --> 01:38:59,832
Hey.

1082
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:04,526
Hey.

1083
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,348
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

1084
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,226
I wanna show you something.

1085
01:40:02,797 --> 01:40:03,764
What?

1086
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:35,987
I'm Edward Cullen.

1087
01:41:34,289 --> 01:41:35,586
How did you do that?

1088
01:41:37,192 --> 01:41:38,420
Been practicing.

1089
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:42,591
Now you know.

1090
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:49,098
Nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.

1091
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,369
There's one exception.

1092
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:04,783
Will you show me again?

1093
01:42:06,455 --> 01:42:07,945
We've got a lotta time.

1094
01:42:10,092 --> 01:42:11,423
Forever.

1095
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:15,555
Forever.
